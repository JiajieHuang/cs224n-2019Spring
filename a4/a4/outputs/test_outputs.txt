you know , one of the great <unk> at travel , and one of the joys of the scientific research is in common with the people that can remember the old days , that their past is still in the wind , touch it from the rain <unk> .
just the knowledge that <unk> still travels beyond the milky way , or the importance of the oldest of the oldest of the inuit are still full of meaning , or that the buddhist <unk> is still tracking the breath of anthropology , which means the central revelation of anthropology to memory , is the idea that the <unk> of anthropology in the world .
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we have to figure out the <unk> separation through death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us all of us singing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> in the forests of borneo in the forests , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the midwest , <unk> <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara , and this is the random <unk> on the sahara .
all these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways to guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , you can only meet with hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world form a network of <unk> and <unk> lives that are <unk> the earth , and the most important thing to earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere knows .
you can imagine that cultural <unk> can imagine as a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspiration and intuitions , which has been defined by human imagination to the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species of species .
and the same way that biosphere was turned out , this happened with the <unk> -- only greater speed .
not a biologist , for example , claim that 50 percent or more of all species are before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the field of the biological diversity -- hardly what &apos;s known as <unk> <unk> in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is extinction .
when every one of them in this room was born , we were talking about 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the totality of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means to find the soul of a specific culture to the physical world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , you don &apos;t have half the ears of kids .
they &apos;re not taught about infants . that means , if nothing is done , you &apos;re dead already dead .
what could be more lonely than the silence to be one of the last of your people who are talking to your language , don &apos;t have an opportunity to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope ?
and yet , if this horrible destiny actually happens to someone anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks dies , an older person dies , and take the last <unk> of an old language with themselves .
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world not be a better place if we all talk about the language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this language . &quot;
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you could not speak your own language .
so , in a way , i want to take you on a trip today through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to make them understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now , there are some of us who kind of forget that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his .
take the example of this kid in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> from the east from holy snakes .
this is a people that don &apos;t cognitively different between the colors blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest that people are dependent on .
they &apos;ve been called a curious language and a <unk> , which is , you know , marry somebody who talks about a different language .
all of this roots in the history of the past , the strange to these big houses where we &apos;re talking about six or seven languages , though , is that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
they just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first people , the first one in 1958 .
in 1957 in 1957 , five <unk> tried to take contact and made an awful mistake .
they <unk> <unk> photos from the air that we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people in the rainforest have never seen anything in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face or to see the character , found that the business business business business are , killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but they don &apos;t just kill the <unk> with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we went back to eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death of death , and when we did the people with a <unk> bit of it , they gave them to be that one of the people had so old that he was going to kill it by his age .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forests , which was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of an animal that &apos;s smell from 40 steps and determine what animal &apos;s owned .
i got a really amazing job in the early 1990s , when i asked my professor at harvard , if i was interested in trying to infiltrate the foundation of the <unk> societies , which were the foundation of <unk> and <unk> societies that were used the foundation of <unk> and <unk> .
so , to give a sense to give a sense to give a sense of , of course , i had to think about this remarkable belief of knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to have the big world experience , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , and of course , there was a <unk> of this very profound religious thoughts that during the tragic diaspora diaspora diaspora the <unk> .
but what makes you interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living gives birth to the spirits .
the spirits can be <unk> from under the large water , answers to the rhythm of the living , to be temporarily <unk> the soul of the living , so that the <unk> for a brief moment is to god .
<unk> likes to say <unk> , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you are going to take you from the mind , how can you harm you ?
so let &apos;s look at these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal without combustion , an amazing illustration of the mind of the mind that the body is going to make up the body that it &apos;s <unk> when it gets in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met was the <unk> from the sierra nevada from the sierra nevada of <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the ancient <unk> civilization that the caribbean <unk> the caribbean of the west , and in the aftermath of the conquest , this people moved into a <unk> <unk> massively back over the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquered <unk> .
to the day of the day , they will be governed by a ritual priesthood , and education is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at the base of the glacier for 18 years of <unk> , at the base of 18 years of <unk> , at the base of 18 years of <unk> , they &apos;re being able to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they
and during all this time , they become culturally active in the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers , and their prayers , the cosmic , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- or the balance .
at the end of these amazing <unk> , one day , one day , one day , one day , it &apos;s taken out after the first time , and for the first time in her life , at the age of 18 , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of the first light of the first light , suddenly the sun starts to <unk> the
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we cut down either <unk> and the old rumor of the hate wild <unk> , which in his simplification is a <unk> thought , or on the other hand , and say these people are more connected to nature as we do .
so , native are neither <unk> , nor they were weakened .
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or cold <unk> of tibet , but they still have formed , through time and ritual that is shaped a mystery <unk> of the earth , which is not shaped by the idea of the earth , but to be aware of the idea that the earth can be <unk> .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes that are growing up in the world that the mountain is a key thing to be able to be , or their fate will be a very different relationship , and have a different relationship to this resource , and that place , a bunch of rocks can be a bunch of rocks .
whether he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and he believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
and that made me another human being as my friends under the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits , who are the <unk> spirits out of the world , ghosts that would be involved in their <unk> .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took on april last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful compound from the repertoire of the <unk> .
what &apos;s so fascinating is not just the most powerful potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s made of processing . it &apos;s made really from two different sources , and on one side , there &apos;s these wooden <unk> , which is a series of <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that are <unk> to serotonin and <unk> and <unk> .
in case you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , like this stuff , this substance , which they create in different ways also is <unk> .
it was <unk> to <unk> it from a <unk> shot , <unk> by <unk> paintings and the landing of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have a professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the <unk> years , and i argued that you could not submit this <unk> as a <unk> , because at the moment you feel the effects of the impact .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be taken <unk> because it &apos;s in a human gut enzyme with names , of course , <unk> .
they can only be filled with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now what &apos;s fascinating is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> are <unk> of the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself .
so , how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species are plants that don &apos;t find these two <unk> plants , which , if they combine this way to combine a kind of <unk> version , that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism and try and error , which it turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , they have 17 varieties of <unk> that they can see all of the distance in the forest that are in our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them how to justify their <unk> and say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you can take each other of the 17 variants at <unk> , and they sing them in a different <unk> .
now , this doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting in terms .
now , the problem of the problem is that even those of us who have the very difficult position of the native citizens , they &apos;re looking at them as <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of limited to the past , as the real world , which is our world .
so , the fact is that , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be remembered for its wars in 300 years , but rather than an era that we were present , and that massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either have supported or passively , and the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> hearing not be less to sioux sioux when they were arch and arrow tasks than americans stopped being the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> ; it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ugly face of sovereignty .
and wherever you go around in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the doom of extinction . these are dynamically living peoples that are being <unk> by intermolecular forces , which is about their own capacity of <unk> in southeast asia .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i have a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people , is being convicted of <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle of the people &apos;s lifestyle is not just not convicted , but generally , as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at a <unk> level .
i once traveling with a young colleague of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to lhasa , and i came to see the face of behind the statistics of which you hear about , 6,000 sacred people who have been transformed during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as a followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was being killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle dismissed with her holiness the diaspora to bring people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned , as punishment , for the crimes of wealthy .
he was smuggled in jail at the age of two , in order to hide himself under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live with him .
the nurse that these brave did <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
and one day she stepped out on a <unk> <unk> , and they had to put them on a heavy <unk> for seven years .
the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end of the end , we really have a choice in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , who said before she died before she died , that it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we &apos;re moving towards a thread , not only the whole range of human imagination , not only to see the entire range of human imagination on a more fundamental way .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and us at this moment the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the priesthood , through the prose of the priesthood , <unk> <unk> and surplus created -- found only 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these <unk> to the importance of the human being being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be the possibility of what we are : people with full awareness that are important to the importance of all people and gardens a space to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took up at the northern end of the <unk> when i went to <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the eastern government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years in the course of our domination , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s <unk> man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sledge were originally wrapped out of fish that was produced in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the white storm .
he <unk> out , let &apos;s put his pants out of <unk> , and he <unk> in his hand , and when the feces began to wildlife , he formed them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of the <unk> , and it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and browsing a dishes , and he took the skeleton of the dog , and <unk> a sledge , <unk> a dog and <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> belt .
so you can do something like this .
and this is a symbol of a symbol of the opposition of the inuit of the inuit , and all the indigenous people around the world .
the eastern government gave the complete control of the complete control of an area that is bigger than california and texas together .
it &apos;s our new country and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for people and reach in and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to the distant goals of the earth , to realize that they are not away at all .
they are the <unk> of somebody .
it represent parts of the human imagination that <unk> into the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children &apos;s part of the geography of our own children .
so what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think that politicians will never reach .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website get 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re going to find a series of trips to the <unk> where we take our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re blinded by the stuff that you have , and hopefully , one after the other one of the central <unk> of anthropology , that this world has made , in a very different way , is that the wisdom of all people can
thank you .
what i &apos;m first about to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we think of microsoft as part of it as part of it , in a single year , <unk> , and it &apos;s an environment where you can possibly handle a local amount of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , which are <unk> and continually <unk> , and <unk> , in some ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this one is like a scan of <unk> , and it &apos;s in one area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter because the only thing that the power of a system can be like that is the number of pixel on their screen in every moment . it has also a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house house of dickens , every column is a chapter .
in order to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also have something on the corner of this particular copy of this particular copy .
we &apos;ve designed a false ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added some additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or some technical specs .
and this really takes these ideas to get these limitations of space available on the screen .
we hope that this means no more nuanced and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , that is mapping one of the very obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this realm .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
<unk> on the top image of nasa .
let &apos;s get something else .
this is even live on the internet . they can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which really connects two different technologies to each other .
one is <unk> , and the other one is a very good research on <unk> , who was a very good research on <unk> , a <unk> university in washington , under the counseling of steve <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
and rick <unk> from microsoft &apos;s research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we can create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and be able to make this experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial structure of the images is here in fact .
the <unk> have these images together so they put the real room in the real room , which these photographs were made near the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , and you can see these elements of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> , and these things were all set up in relation to each space .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to give you other environments .
there are the ones that are much <unk> .
i &apos;d like to show straight one of the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> where we first worked in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is actually the punchline behind this technology , which is not necessarily so obvious .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral notre dame who was done entirely on the computer with pictures of flickr , put them just notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> , and so on this orange orange cone represents a picture that was discovered .
so this is all <unk> , and they all are in the way in terms of each other .
and we can navigate through this very simple way .
. you know , i never believed i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception .
so , i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : all of it &apos;s to be able to professional <unk> , which is a pretty large number of them all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
many of them are <unk> on faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that was really recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the whole collective of memory of how to look visually the earth -- and everything gets connected .
all these photographs are connected , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
look at this as the legacy of stephen <unk> &apos;s virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s through complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s increasing its use for the user with the user .
their own photographs are going to take up with metadata <unk> , which has another person &apos;s idea .
if somebody has done the effort , all of these saints , and tell me who they &apos;re all , then my photograph of the notre <unk> suddenly <unk> with all of these data , and i can use them as starting to go to the place of other people , and then i can use them as a starting point to go from other <unk> .
and of course , byproduct of all that are the immense rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , which is not only by <unk> or satellite images and so on , but with collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software is possible that at a certain time , within the next years , all the images that are being used by somebody in the world are going to be linked together ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter anything else .
if you want to make it <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of <unk> information that many of these images have .
how if you do a <unk> for images , where you put sentences and enter and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what this is .
but what if the picture is they connected to all their pictures ?
and then the scope of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance , which makes it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which i hope in harmony with the other things you &apos;ve heard . and i &apos;m going to try to make yourself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all the western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is maximizing the good of the good people of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , valuable , sense , a fundamental assumption for human human .
when people have freedom , each of us is about to do the things that we try to choose , and no one has to decide for us .
the path to maximize freedom is choice to maximize .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more women have them .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to mind that it would not be challenging .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives too .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there are 175 <unk> in my grocery store , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy to make a large number of <unk> <unk> , in the unlikely case , that none of the 175 in the store is right .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , amplifier , and in this one electronics , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together , we can put together <unk> million different systems of plants , put together the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy that was able to do every telephone that you wanted to do as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
and a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that right now in your business , you can be sure it &apos;s going to be soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk in the business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do much .
in other aspects of life , which is much more valuable than buying objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer in the united states that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says we could do a do or we could do b .
a has these benefits and the risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risk and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it patients autonomy , and that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shifting the burden of responsibility for the gathering of someone who knows something -- a doctor &apos;s burden to someone who knows something -- <unk> the doctor -- is not in the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing for <unk> drugs like them and me , if you think about it , that &apos;s not a sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you expect to call the doctor on the next morning and ask a change in the prescription .
something like our identity as our identity is now a question of how this slide is supposed to show .
we &apos;re not <unk> identity , we invent them .
and we invent as often as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and they were able to get them as fast as they could , and then they got children as quickly as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re very carefully carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married later ? should i have to have children , or do you know ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions about whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do with you and not a good grade in my class .
and in fact they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed with carl <unk> , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day of every place on the planet -- to the hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that incredible freedom of choice is we have to make decisions about work , again and again , and again , whether we should be working or not work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our phone on the one hand , and our blackberry to the other hip , and our laptop probably is in our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all shut down , every minute in which we <unk> our child , we &apos;re going to ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it will certainly be your experience of your child &apos;s experience as it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we now are life looks like this .
and the question is , is the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
and we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
all those choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
there &apos;s an effect in the way that it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
and with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example , a study of investing in volunteers in volunteers .
one colleague of mine had access to <unk> <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> company who was <unk> the employer , recorded it about two percent .
they &apos;re offering 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees spend less than if they had five to five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> that are in choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose that they delayed it in the morning .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it &apos;s never coming .
now , you know , it &apos;s not only called the people who have to eat dog food , when they go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to travel , it means that they &apos;re making great <unk> of your employer to make a great deal of your employer .
in fact , by not participation , it would have been to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
and it &apos;s a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes sense that the world looks like this .
you want to really make the decision , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment in , or even the wrong investment .
so that &apos;s an effect . the other effect is that even when we go through the paralysis and make a decision , we end up less pleased with the result of the selection , when we had the opportunity to have had less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is different from the big array of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which <unk> is already perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have been able to have a choice that would have been better , and what &apos;s going on is the <unk> alternative choice .
the more possibilities that there is , the easier it is , it &apos;s <unk> for the choices that they make .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has done a great point in telling him how much the way we evaluate things are dependent on what we compare .
well , when there &apos;s very many alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that they exclude , which makes them less happy with the alternatives that they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn a man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends for two weeks of the idea that he has missed the chance to have a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce happiness that we get through our choice , even when what we chose is fantastic .
and the more ways that we have to choose , the more attractive properties of this choice are going to take into account for the treatment .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon is making some statements .
he makes a point of life in now , and maybe to do things about it .
but a more important thing that he does is , always , who you decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to do less <unk> .
third , expectations of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was just jeans , and they bought them , and they got <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they carried them for long enough , and they were going to have a lot of time .
so i went to buy new jeans after many years old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales guy said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , easily <unk> or large ?
do you want the buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid ?
do you want in jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far down , blah , blah blah blah , blah , blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i was like , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the kind of thing that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all these damn jeans , and he goes down with the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best jeans i ever had .
i &apos;d better . all of those choices made me better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain to myself .
the reason that i felt worse was , with all these options , my expectations of what a good pair of jeans is , i got up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they were just in a way .
when they came in 100 species , damn it would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i had got to what i expected , and what i had had was disappointing myself to what i expected .
and adding opportunities to the lives of the people in the lives of people inevitably have to increase the expectations of the people about how well they &apos;re going to be .
and this leads to fewer happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what this is going on here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it used to be better than anything was worse than anything , it was worse than anything , it was possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection -- the best thing you can have to hope to do is do things as well as you would expect them .
they &apos;re not going to have a pleasant <unk> because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all came to -- the secret to the <unk> is low expectations .
i want to say -- a brief moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have been able to do it better . i didn &apos;t know .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a <unk> sitting , if there is only one way to buy , is that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why , who &apos;s responsible , and you ask yourself why , you know , what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying a <unk> , and they ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and if the outcomes are good , you feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
a clinical depression exploded in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but an <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have seen the <unk> because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to be able to explain those experiences themselves .
and so this is the case that it &apos;s going to make us better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than something .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that point in a long time , we &apos;ve missed our greater good .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy question , the thing about thinking about that is , what all of these choice is in the industrialized societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you whose problem is not the problem of big choice .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and annoying is , steve <unk> tells you yesterday how these expensive and hard to <unk> car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re not concerned for that .
if something that enables people to make decisions that allows people to make decisions to the societies in which people were shifted to little choice , not only the lives of people improve , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
it &apos;s going to be worried that it &apos;s all better -- not only the poor -- because all these big choices are <unk> us .
so finally , reading this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what do this fish know ?
you know , you know nothing possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i came to think about the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , that everything is possible , they get happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> being a metaphor is a recipe for misery and , i guess disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve got biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by designing new life and build new life .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists tried to understand and that &apos;s on different levels .
and we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been involved in nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> <unk> , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate life or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to get it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to ours , they trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we look at all of these genes that we can do one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that the only way to synthesize this chromosome is actually <unk> what allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of the fundamental questions .
so , so we started to synthesize a chromosome ?
is it possible to make the chemistry really big , which has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can launch the chromosome ?
so one chromosome is so just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has increased very slowly , but yet we have increased , and our final dot would be on an exponential curve now .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years before we did the first experiments before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it &apos;s a very difficult thing .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , and it &apos;s a <unk> process , but the longer you make a piece , the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new way to build these little pieces and put the mistakes .
that &apos;s our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little pieces , and we made a <unk> molecule , and we had a dna molecule , about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting stage came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and we gave the bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made the viral particles .
and the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killing e. coli .
recently , i talked about the oil industry , and they said that they could really understand this model .
they laughed . they laughed .
so we think that this is actually a situation in software that actually can build your own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go even further , and we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters of genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re building it , we build it in tapes from the size of a living cell to understand what the individual components are a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome in 1995 , they &apos;ve been <unk> in a mistake per 10,000 pairs per 10,000 pairs .
we found the <unk> of 30 . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been allowed to be <unk> .
a part of the design is to make it , to make the 50 letters long , and they have to overlap with other parts of the pieces that we have to build smaller <unk> .
we have unique elements into this .
you may have heard that we have <unk> installed .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , phrases .
initially we only signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so that we can just break them into enzymes , and there are enzymes that we can fix and then together .
and we &apos;ve started to make pieces , starting with pieces that had five to 5,000 characters in the sun , added these together to put these together in order to put together these together to <unk> these together .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in computation so we could sequence it because we tried to create a very robust process of creating what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to this really big piece -- with 100,000 base pairs -- you &apos;re not just going to grow in e. coli . it exceeds all the possibilities of modern biology , and so we used to put other mechanisms .
we knew about the mechanism of <unk> <unk> that uses biology to fix dna that can put these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of three million rads of radiation .
you see the upper field , the chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has put together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move around , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we made by using these processes -- in fact , we use <unk> using the right design of the pieces , we put it together . yeast adds together it automatically automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> .
this is footage about a duration of six seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve only done recently .
this is about <unk> letters in <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we were able to print it with a minimum of 10 and without the distances , it would include <unk> pages , just around this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s a lot more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus and gives you one else , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about this clone .
now , in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we have recently shown that you can transplant a complete transplanting one chromosome from one cell to others and do that happen .
we &apos;re going to put the chromosome on a <unk> . roughly , these two are away from the other like human beings and mice . we gave some of these chromosome so we could select this chromosome . we <unk> it to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing as we put it into a cell .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end , but we &apos;ve tried to keep the process .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of times , in one second , thousands of characteristics in just a single species .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene changed at a time that has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> , which actually , digest the dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added from .
it was <unk> in the cell , and then the other chromosome is <unk> as foreign material , and so we only had a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> blue because of the genes we &apos;ve added through .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we have given in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we breathe .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can move by changing the <unk> , very dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re about to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it , i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has three people on the planet for anyone in 1946 ; within 40 years it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion drums of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million drums a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of this material on the atmosphere .
so we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of this .
and we run into the limits of biological reality , and we have this idea .
we have technology today because of these fast materials , to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you think of these 20 million different genes , or to create these processes to create <unk> or new vaccines , we can change with a small team more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> and so on .
this is a recording of actual <unk> at which we &apos;re working with you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what &apos;s going to look like , and we know exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
we now focus on fuels the fourth generation .
now you &apos;ve seen corn corn , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation that are going to have much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how do we think the only way of biology is going to have a huge impact of the cost of food , or the limitation is going to be if we see co2 as the beginning , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells that go through the way .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different methods .
this is an organism in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in nearly <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s carbon dioxide in methane by using hydrogen as a energy source .
we can study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could simply be brought into <unk> , the co2 emissions in the fuel to power that process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like <unk> of the <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise you can &apos;t do it at ted ?
but in the same time , we &apos;re working on that right now , the same approaches to developing vaccines vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and they have a dollar too little , if it goes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by creating <unk> vaccines .
this is what the future might possibly look like with changes , can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we are years to improve people &apos;s years . our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s like that . and for all those at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
and his job is to create the conditions that are less than a second <unk> second at the beginning of the universe -- and this to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine from geneva .
we take pictures of these detectors in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular image of the atlas in which you see the scale .
last september last year , the machine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge shifts in the control room .
it &apos;s an image of the first <unk> which all the way around the lhc , then <unk> at a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is the greatest <unk> , or this when someone went to the google side and found the front page .
it means that we reached an cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do here -- this golden wires here .
these wires emit <unk> when the machine goes on <unk> .
well , the engineers among you are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
they can do that because when you get it very far cool , they &apos;ll be called <unk> .
so at minus <unk> , colder than the space between stars , these wires can withstand tension .
in one of the connections between <unk> magnets at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
so the wires slightly heat up and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is a wonderful thing , if you can imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and move around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
now , they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn to it and expect to be first data in june , or july , and we &apos;re going to sit on our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , there &apos;s some sort of spark of accidents , the value of science and <unk> on such borders , and it &apos;s easy to reject this .
i think the fact that it is so hard to reach the fact that we reach beyond our borders , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to an english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as he was , when he defended the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his apprentice was michael <unk> , which was , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , that there &apos;s no mystery to the development of the human mind .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
so writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect to change it .
but there &apos;s a recent bit of a weird little weird in my life and my career that brought me to this work completely .
this strange thing was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , love , different than all of my previous books in the world went out and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated , i &apos;m going to be treated like extinction .
seriously -- the doom .
so , for example , they come to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will ever <unk> that success ?
don &apos;t have a fear that you <unk> their whole life , and i never met a book that you &apos;re interested in the world ? never again ?
okay , that makes really courage .
however , it would be worse if i don &apos;t remember that , over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , for the first time , i said that i wanted to be a writer , the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you fear , never succeed ?
do you don &apos;t worry that the humiliation of a <unk> killing ?
don &apos;t you feel frightened that you &apos;re going to <unk> your life for life , and you never come up on a <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ? <unk> <unk> ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i have a lot more things that nobody &apos;s going to get a lot of .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently , and i ask myself , why ?
it &apos;s reasonable ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to be afraid of doing the work to do it ?
and what about the creative enterprises do with our creative state of life -- in a way , how else do they do not ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist that he asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not received the reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
but we seem to be writers , but not just the writers , but not only the writers , but the creative ones of all , seem to be the heart of being mental incredibly unstable .
all you have to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds just from the 20th century that died young and a lot of their own hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually have been really neglected in their talents seemed to be really neglected from their talents .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books has killed me a little further .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about their work &apos;s work .
but we don &apos;t even twitch if we &apos;re listening to somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of statements for so long , and we collectively have the idea of this , and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering is always <unk> , and the arts , of course , leads to <unk> .
the question i want to ask today is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel it ? because with only one centimeter away , i &apos;m looking at this notion , i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion .
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how it gets taken over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our big creative encourage .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation , it would be very dangerous to do , to start , this dark path of presumption -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that &apos;s called -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i might have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work is being judged after the most successful success of my last book , which is right ?
i &apos;m going to say it <unk> because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s probably probably my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that can get someone to start at 9 a.m. , gin gin , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of course , it seems to me that i can continue to write a kind of <unk> psychological constructed .
so somehow , i &apos;ve got to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is on the writing .
while i was looking for models for the study of models to do that , i &apos;ve been looking for in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , to see if they might help better or more powerful ideas than we can help to deal with creativity .
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity is coming from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> of creativity , demons <unk> .
it &apos;s known from socrates that he believed he would have a <unk> , he &apos;d given him a lot of time .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative mind , <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the romans really thought that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical thing , which was believed that it was literally living in the walls of a <unk> -- about like <unk> , the <unk> , and the artist in the labor of <unk> , and the artist &apos;s work would be kind of invisible .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected in some things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work brilliant you could not be able to look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this kind of genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s ask the human individual to the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for mythical creatures .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people began to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call a genius of those or artists -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a mere person to allow him to think , he or she &apos;s like the gourd , like the pelvis and the essence and the source of all , <unk> , <unk> , endless <unk> is a little too much responsibility to <unk> .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
that was deformed and distorted whole egos , and it creates all that expectations of success .
i think that these <unk> has annihilated our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just erase this <unk> for 500 years , not just erase in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who are really going to be <unk> on top of the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people who have <unk> <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is : why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes sense as much as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process , which is , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always <unk> .
in fact , he can feel really <unk> .
i had a encounter with a encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , who was now about 90 , but she told me that she grew up in the fields in virginia , she told me that she was working up in the fields in virginia . she said she could feel like a poem on the landscape . she said she would feel like a
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
it was going to <unk> over the country .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could just do it for a moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> run like the devil .
she ran out like the devil in the house while she was being tracked by this poem , and it was only about her to get quickly to a sheet of paper and a pencil , so she could get it through and capture and capture on the sheet .
in other ways , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and she didn &apos;t roll the house through her , and she missed it . she said it would go on land after another poet .
and then there were those moments -- i &apos;m going to never forget -- she said that there were moments in which she was almost missed .
so she runs out to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and the poem was going through her , and she picks up a pencil just as it took through them and then -- she said -- it was like it was like to grab your other hand .
she caught the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back in her body , and she took it on the sheet of paper .
and the poem came <unk> and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i thought , is creepy -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not at all like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i have to work every day at the same time every day and sweat , <unk> and really awkward <unk> .
but even i &apos;ve got this thing in my <unk> sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done this .
even i had been working or ideas that came out of a source through me that i can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we kick in relation to our minds without losing our minds , but it &apos;s actually keeping us in intellectual health .
for me , the best living example of how to create tom <unk> , i was allowed to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was the embodiment of the <unk> artist , which was trying , this <unk> of creative impulses , who lived in him , to master and deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me he was driving on a freeway in los angeles , and there was all changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he was looking at a little fragment of a melody , which is how it &apos;s often <unk> for him , it &apos;s excruciatingly hard to do it , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s <unk> . it can &apos;t grab it .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to get these old <unk> in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll lose that song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of going to panic , he stopped .
he finished all the <unk> , and he did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , sorry , can you see that i drive car ?
i think of this as if i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come to a moment when i &apos;m going to take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , anyone else today .
go <unk> cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself , which was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds it was , it was <unk> when he took the genius out of it , where he did nothing in a anger , and he realized that there was no <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , outside thing that was not completely tom .
when i heard that story , it was a bit of the way i worked , and i had saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell in one of these specimens that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s going to start . you start to think about something .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom had talked to the free sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript and i was talking to my comment in the direction of an empty corner of the room .
i talked out loud , you know , you know , you , and i both know if this book isn &apos;t entirely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i &apos;ve invested , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you have to show up , you have to show your percentage of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m going to continue to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask to report that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of the end , it &apos;s like following , centuries ago , <unk> people in the deserts of holy dances with holy dances , who were stopped for hours -- to dawn .
these are always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , again , very rare , something special happened , and one of the performers actually became <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen such a performance in your life .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancers go through a kind of <unk> , he didn &apos;t do anything unlike it ever before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything added together .
and all of a sudden , he seemed no longer in human beings .
it was lighting up from inside and down from the bottom , and it &apos;s all <unk> through a <unk> fire .
so , as something happened , people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god <unk> .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting <unk> <unk> : when they brought the <unk> visited when they took this practice , the pronunciation has changed over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear at <unk> and <unk> .
if a actors in spain was something impossible , something magic has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , bravo , great , bravo look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part will follow the next morning when the dancers wake up and realizes that it was 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he no longer a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s merely a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe it will never be back to these heights .
and maybe it &apos;s never going to be any of god &apos;s name when he turns out , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most profound adjustments of an creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if you didn &apos;t believe the most extraordinary aspects of their existence .
if you might just believe that you &apos;re one loan -- from a <unk> source of your life that will be passed on someone else , when they &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think of security in the last few months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to appear soon -- as the dangerous , frightening , <unk> successor to my success .
what i have to say to myself is , if i &apos;m going crazy about it , is that i &apos;m not afraid .
not <unk> .
just make your job .
be still for your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dance , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that you ask you is decide , for a moment , for a moment a moment to show a miracle of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance still your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i think and i feel that we should teach the lessons .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you in spite of all of this , just to say that you &apos;ve just got the mere human love and the <unk> .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i &apos;ve shown these two slides to illustrate that the arctic of the arctic , which has been the size of the lower 48 of the bottom of the bottom of the lower 48 states , is shrunk .
but this doesn &apos;t press strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not showing the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and declining in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> , which is what happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is tagged red .
as you can see , it grows on the <unk> , and this is the annual ice in winter ; and it &apos;s declining in the summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old , is almost like blood from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming on the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon dioxide in which there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon , which is when it &apos;s <unk> , by microbes .
and compared to the whole amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , that amount is going to double as we cross this critical point .
now , today in some flat lakes in alaska , methane from itself from the water itself .
professor <unk> at the university of alaska has traveled to another one another one on another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to <unk> us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat heat warms up in the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but volume are significantly greater than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know , like the level of sea level , it &apos;s going to go into the sea .
these rivers are taking faster .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , scientists reported that the entire continent now has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed over a few <unk> , is especially at melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see new lakes that were glaciers just a few years ago .
forty percent of all the people in the world get half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> has expanded .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s going to be most fresh water .
california was a <unk> percent reduction in the sierra coast of the sierra indian .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions you read them are serious .
this <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all around the world have been increasing in a really <unk> and unprecedented degree .
four times as many in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific precisely , the american continent west and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there is a common decline in the ocean in the ocean .
the biggest factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the still biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , combined with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken out of the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar test last <unk> to promote clean charcoal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the <unk> <unk> for christmas was this one .
<unk> is a <unk> , happy kid .
there are <unk> and abundance in america , and it helps our economy grow .
<unk> , the <unk> will be cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and affordable , and workers stay in pay and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear one , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate protection is called two campaigns .
this is one , one of them .
we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it to the top <unk> , to spend a substantial test on a <unk> to get a <unk> on the way to get the truth about coal .
the fact is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave it to us .
<unk> coal , you heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , <unk> <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is really remarkable clean <unk> that you see here .
look at it right now , this is today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that we all connect is our dependence on <unk> fuels as dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to <unk> ourselves out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , to make us safer and help us stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america new . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels that aspirate our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good jobs .
<unk> america , it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come up , go ahead . &quot;
we need to go far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
so i want to start to ask you to go to the time of your childhood , when you were playing with <unk> .
while she realized how to reach out the hands of reaching the hands and <unk> the <unk> and moves , they learned , to actually think about the problems of understanding and changing the relationship with understanding and changing the context of understanding .
spatial thinking is closely connected to how we understand most of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i started myself wondering : what if we could use computers , instead of a digital tour on a flat <unk> -- what if we could use computers , instead of a digital <unk> .
and this question was so emotional that we decided to study the answer and evolved <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a more interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can detect their motions , and they have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are physically physically , so you can only move them through the reach of the hands of hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of engineering to manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a conscious awareness of their movements , recognize each other , and the subtleties of our instincts with them , we can start to explore new and entertaining <unk> .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for <unk> <unk> , and when i put it in one direction , the video will play forward , and if i put it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so when i put them side-by-side , they make it interest .
if they &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , they &apos;re also going to find a little bit nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their motions and slope .
now , an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could apply the ordinary gestures on data like the colors as you do that with liquids .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;ll mix up .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> a little bit .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we can give people the possibility of fast and error and see the results .
here i am -- this is a series of numbers i &apos;m doing with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get a round of letters to each other random letter , and as you try to form words , they &apos;re going to be a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a new <unk> and new opportunity to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and try a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; make words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people doing it .
this is our youngest <unk> there on the bottom right .
it turns out he wanted to take a pile of <unk> .
so for him , they were only <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by <unk> the <unk> from the table , which shows this character .
this is the sun .
the sun goes up .
now he puts a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by <unk> the <unk> and you can put the characters together , let the characters interact ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story , and he can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing now is to show it a little bit of a competition for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as a sound like <unk> , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can select which you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes into the sequence that you can organize in any pattern .
and you put them up by simply holding a <unk> to a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you hook it up with a certain sound , and then it tends to put it out .
and then they are then <unk> effects like speed and volume , which you do on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start where we <unk> the <unk> into two <unk> <unk> , and we put them in a row , and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about this .
and now i just divide the filters with the drums so i can control the effect .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by accelerating the speed in one or other direction .
and now i just divide the filters with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it happens .
and i don &apos;t have to do it in advance , but i can improvise in front of it ; they &apos;re extending or shorten .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by <unk> the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new <unk> , which are better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you part of this new <unk> and some of the ways of showing you what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you with you is that we are at the cusp of this new generation of engineering to interaction with this new media that will bring information into our world that corresponds to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very pleased to be there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to go back a little bit , and that &apos;s what <unk> is about modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been studying biology , and i &apos;ve been studying biology , and i &apos;ve started that , because i just wanted to know , because i just wanted to know what i was doing in the study of the study .
so , this was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
and i think that biology in general now is , so far , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology , and so on .
extremely important is now extremely important and much , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like all these genetically genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
now there are craig venter in the <unk> trying to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
there are also things that are totally done in the everyday , which most people are not aware of , but for example , <unk> that allow us to wash 40 degrees laundry , are also genetically engineered <unk> .
and the list can continue endlessly on .
and so from the interest of this technology , i &apos;m going to keep there on further .
so what &apos;s now <unk> now ?
most people know that from the <unk> .
and a computer , hacking , and then it &apos;s going to be like this , yes , the hackers break down somewhere , and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the <unk> , because that &apos;s not what it actually is what it actually started , and what &apos;s actually going on behind it .
and in fact , the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it was also caused by the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> thing to be a <unk> , which is simplify the things that you can do better , and how do you make it better .
and it turns out it &apos;s taken up with software , but there &apos;s also there in <unk> , and there &apos;s also a whole thing that <unk> all kinds of <unk> things .
and now , as well as biology , and that &apos;s where i want to say that this metaphor , which is from synthetic biology , is that biology is actually a more abstract code , which is a more abstract code , because it &apos;s a more abstract code , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can make it as well , and you can find it as well , and that &apos;s what i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
that &apos;s actually what really did <unk> eight really form , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe , and with cooperation in india , in india , in india &apos;s network , and it &apos;s now a variety of people around the world .
it &apos;s got more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and the philosophers and in collaboration with scientists to be preoccupied with these technologies and asking questions and process the creative way , there &apos;s <unk> and everything .
but it &apos;s always about trying to find such a <unk> access to have an playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is out of the <unk> network , which is actually a kind of forum where it &apos;s going to be true and online .
these are a little bit more technical set , and also a little bit of <unk> on the way , and then they &apos;re going to ask , yes , questions .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular thing , it &apos;s taken a scene that i &apos;d like to <unk> .
here &apos;s the image on the left you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a school , a private school , nonprofit charity , where everyone can get .
kids , old , all sorts of people , all kinds of people go through it , and they have a laboratory in the lab and look at what you can do when these <unk> are .
here on the lower left is a group in indonesia , which is that there &apos;s a pretty long time .
even longer than those other networks are .
they &apos;re also looking at an artistic aspect of an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , <unk> , and combine that in pretty much ways .
a group of ankara i &apos;ve met before a while ago , which is a <unk> , who would like to give the public more what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;re learning so on <unk> little actions and trying to explain what <unk> is .
and i have a lecture on the other image in copenhagen in the medical museum , with an exhibition on the subject .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only thing that is actually all together is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and in the same way , in society , and asking them , so , you know , what do you do , what do you want to join , have your interest in doing that ?
so , <unk> , to hack in biology now , you need some material .
so , of course , you need biological materials , and you need tools also , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you normally understand under a lab is that kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , very distant , only for <unk> , educated academics with <unk> and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each one of any <unk> has actually evolved more developed technology than most of them , that &apos;s really like that .
and it o &apos;clock with that premise with this premise , for example , is trying to have tried <unk> <unk> in england , <unk> a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it turns out , and then <unk> bacteria .
so everybody who has been <unk> a soup that he left too long , has been done too long .
i tried that in my lab , and i &apos;m trying to scale a little bit , and then i bought that <unk> on ebay and made a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so a <unk> , so / <unk> .
it &apos;s actually not supposed to be a joke now .
down here in this picture you see the lab , in <unk> , so a <unk> garage with all kinds of <unk> garage with all kinds of <unk> , a group in paris , which has been pretty successful and pretty successful things , which is pretty successful .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , this one , such a kind of <unk> mechanism for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s where there are people who are going to do this at home , to big organizations larger organizations , which would be more <unk> in <unk> form .
but always the idea that it is simply to be simple and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as international group , when we were aware of ourselves , we were actually aware of ourselves as the real scene , and we are online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are doing it always .
and then came from the <unk> website on the founder of the founder , and we said <unk> , we also have to make ourselves real , and then have a real meeting , and then they have two events organized , one in london , <unk> 10 , and in san francisco .
and then , there was also <unk> , who are we , what do we want to tell , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> out of this .
and it was quite intuitive , so everyone has just like his wishes , his and what stops him moving , expressed .
and i think , i think , a whole good code .
and then we don &apos;t have it this is not that , but that &apos;s , i think , has relatively good , people are quite convinced about this .
and then we &apos;ve actually tried to go back into the academic world , but there &apos;s somehow not there .
so i think we have a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do now ?
a project i did with the <unk> <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to create a so-called optical trap or optical object .
that &apos;s when you focus a beam beam , in a room , you can capture little particles in the air , or in the fluid , and then moving in this focus , so that &apos;s being captured there , so it &apos;s captured there like this as a consequence .
this really works in the academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , we might get , you know , take a webcam , the <unk> , the lens turns , the lens turns out , the lens is <unk> .
that &apos;s where you see down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> the laser and then tries to focus on that camera .
and that doesn &apos;t work all the time , but we still learned a lot .
so this is another project that came from the french group from paris , and that &apos;s really cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s got to do so much like this , like a <unk> , or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with <unk> , his cat scan is sam <unk> .
he &apos;d built this on this helmet there , and he &apos;s in the cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors able to go in the room , sit on this chair , put this helmet up .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or as they thought , are different lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states that you just have to do with this <unk> thing is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying the genes , to multiply , <unk> , fragments that you can make it visible .
so , if i do that , you know , the <unk> of the crime at the crime scene , then they &apos;re going to collect any of these things , and then they &apos;re doing this method , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this man .
and the machines that are doing something like this , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you buy commercial , the cheapest , they go out of <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not in <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is also a lot of cool technology .
so this is just an application of many you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got two two builders and i said , <unk> , we make it easier and cheaper , and then we made it open source , so we &apos;ve got it out of open source , <unk> , <unk> hardware , <unk> , and have the cheapest vendor of these devices .
i think somehow that six hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly going to be more available .
so i think it &apos;s a very appealing hack .
one project i started to do was build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yeah , like this kind of <unk> , which is about so far , two inches or so .
you invites <unk> <unk> , and then they put them into these <unk> , and then i put them on <unk> , and then they put it on <unk> , and they put it up with this .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is so my prototype that &apos;s kind of my prototype , but it &apos;s kind of like this , so on a branch that goes on a branch , electronics on it , and it was <unk> , and that was the pressure to high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a <unk> , and i was going to do that .
a <unk> , if you get the full power of water , it &apos;s got enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s something like 40 to <unk> bar on it .
and so you can then get these particles very enough , and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euro up , or something like this , <unk> so on the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , for the moment , for the moment , the scene of the scene is just to increase the availability of technology , and also increase the information and <unk> that more people can get involved .
because , as i started saying , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance of making it really good .
because , if you read about it , you know , <unk> , that &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself .
and i think technology will become more important in our modern societies .
and if you can also want to make meaningful decisions in society to make meaningful decisions in society , and join your hand , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it too , and you can understand and understand it .
and then this is the <unk> <unk> and the citizen science .
so , as a citizens will be able to be able to be able to get a citizen through these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who at least put on the website , <unk> website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what is interesting is also that they are in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people , when actually exist .
so i know some who don &apos;t put up .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
in part , with these <unk> , these places put together there .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has only begun .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , <unk> , who are represented all over the world .
and we of course , of course , is that we &apos;re going to stop , and then we &apos;re also getting around and then wired too well , so they can also hold more about it .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and try and try .
now it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and enough energy , you &apos;ll also get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moved to me as a designer , but also in the field of <unk> , and in front of all the things in the field of <unk> .
it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and make them an equal experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us is <unk> , cognitive models , which is so paradigm that has been programmed in our biological memory of very , very long time , and that we can actually generate the only by interactive media .
and this is really amazing , because you actually believe that these <unk> that you &apos;ve encountered there is that it &apos;s actually going to be into the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future that the future is right in us in our <unk> roots .
so what are the <unk> models now ?
i &apos;d like to tell four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain that briefly .
to <unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models we have in the pre-industrial times .
we heard these <unk> models that we are in principle to the virtuality .
that sounds , basically , unusual first .
but i &apos;m going to go into this same time , and i &apos;m going to show you by trying to have a natural relationship to the virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to speak very well since these <unk> models to speak very , very metaphorically , even though we use a relational language today .
and the third area that explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media by definition are <unk> , which includes the neglect of linearity , and what we say , of course , is that we feel the linearity today .
the fourth thing is that history is a place for us a place .
now , how is that with the virtuality which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to just like to prove that .
how many doors did the house in which they live ?
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be able to answer that immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go in the mind through this house , in <unk> you live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it &apos;s <unk> the reality , without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to give care of the virtual reality of the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually show that all the time .
and that &apos;s what this wealth of virtual reality is the virtual reality that the people in the pre-industrial times have required , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in that mind , it played memory .
in this mind , knowledge <unk> and using these virtual images , the imagination , was being passed on .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can do a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time of human beings , and the medium itself was <unk> .
now , if you think of a bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but that &apos;s where i come to talk about .
the heightened tool of <unk> has always been stories .
<unk> , a preacher , so-called <unk> , were to make sure to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong at stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;re going to have <unk> , according to <unk> hours a year of tales .
that means a child who has been able to do most of the most <unk> of his life for most of his life with stories .
now we think our love is stories because we sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is a lot further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , when it &apos;s a particularly impressive thing is that , by se , we realized by se in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the northwest coast of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate , in some way , from island to the island to get food .
and they did this with what &apos;s called <unk> .
you may know that if you &apos;re interested in this , you know , if you &apos;re interested in the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they used to be using it as <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation navigation and the topography of regions and the topography of regions .
which was the language of the <unk> stature .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sounds and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and that &apos;s also allowing you to put these songs together and put in other ways to put these songs together , and go back to the left again .
why don &apos;t we sing from the top of a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening there ?
what happens is that &apos;s so <unk> age .
we &apos;ve got to move before , called <unk> .
what happens is the age of age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book that &apos;s happened .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories of external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> at <unk> , is so far left to say that this is mass media , he &apos;s the book and the picture , so not television , the internet , the internet and so on , what we &apos;re calling as mass media , and so on , what we &apos;re calling as media today .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the age of age .
what does change affect our thinking , and on our <unk> ?
and then the <unk> <unk> of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means , instead of reminded us individually , we have standardized , conventional , common patterns of memories of memories of memories of memories of memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract a language language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in pictures of these things , but we owe them to our language .
we &apos;ve been used to that things happen linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as the law , and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we have been arrested for <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
the question is , what comes right now ?
we had <unk> <unk> , we had the age of age , and we &apos;re now going to take this called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds like science science , i know .
but these kinds of concepts of the design , which will bring us back to these ways to discover our skills back again .
it &apos;s about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain that for a minute .
like , technical concepts like this , like , reality , reality , which is the extended reality .
so , if you look at google <unk> for example , then this is such a concept that lets us combine the virtual world with the real world , that means our <unk> to make the virtual world of something normal , the virtual , to be addressed again .
another example is called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about in my talk in the context of my presentation , where we &apos;re physically moving into <unk> , virtual worlds , all the way in the model of the <unk> .
and other examples are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated from the degree , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re also here today .
you might just get up for a second , so you can go to the break and talk to you about the project .
and this project i brought up as an example of this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
which is , of course , extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;d very likely to be able to see that any people in front of any <unk> , or they &apos;re playing with some of the people who are playing with anything .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in there .
this is a game out .
and this is actually thinking that i discover the outside world , so that i discover the real world again .
and this game connects to the virtual world , so the data that we produce , which we produce with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry i have to <unk> so much .
you can actually explain that much better , because there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at which places have been positive or negative <unk> .
and so , i get from the city to a very different view of the city , and i see negative zones and positive zones of a city , and a very different virtual map of a very real city .
and we can actually look at this now .
ah , what you can see here , excuse me , is another little explanation from what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that my talk , which is in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve gone so a little bit of <unk> in the age of this , that we can be activated by the way complex , technological , new products .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be at them .
now i &apos;ve been asked to do a little bit , if this bag is there , there &apos;s a <unk> bag , and they &apos;re going to talk to me .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate the same thing .
but i &apos;m going to do it again , i &apos;m little curious about it .
yes , kids are from nature , or should be curious , to be curious , designers .
i &apos;m out of the house of the house , and so , of course , i &apos;m also talking about the subject of curiosity , and how do you think again , what we think is , and why we &apos;re going to lose curiosity , and we have to bring it back to new and so forth .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re busy next to the actual experience as a creator .
if professors are going to be curious , they &apos;re often <unk> in like this , &apos; n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
a <unk> to the subject of natural user interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the designers with this natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because the things are supposed to be more intuitive , more natural , <unk> , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually more natural for us , of course , which is <unk> or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve got into the domain of natural user interface , so the next generation of human computers in the way of human computers in the relationship of the human computer , with the relationship of our tools , or how our computer is changing by computing .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing this , which is of course or intuitively .
you may have to look at it again .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a moment , then we &apos;re going to move away from the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern to <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , <unk> through language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate a common language , you could communicate into the same cave or in other areas , cities have created , and it &apos;s created as <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , but something very natural , something very natural .
you also had to learn , so you don &apos;t have a toddler to talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , and of course .
and then , it &apos;s been given by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
it was a <unk> , of course , because , of course , the living language started to <unk> in the form of typeface , which is what <unk> and alive , i start to start and put it in stone , and i also threw it in .
the after i <unk> and when i <unk> , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative as if there &apos;s a life of being alive .
but then <unk> , then <unk> the script as a <unk> , got <unk> .
and then the next generation that we actually are in today live in today .
this is just by pressure and <unk> <unk> typeface with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was as much as <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and others have said , you &apos;re actually <unk> when people start reading , and then the people want to be able to read , and it &apos;s totally <unk> .
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting thing , which is that a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really at the moment in this <unk> stage that we &apos;re going to be involved .
and of course , that confused us , of course , because we see the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what about the old thinking , you don &apos;t tell that in the <unk> and no beef more or other phenomena , which is i just want to be <unk> , and that &apos;s what i want to do with it .
and these two worlds just opened together , new and old .
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , is a lot of many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
now , not more at the local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ecology is a global part .
not , if i think local <unk> and the neighbor is less ecologically , and it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
this is , from the local village , actually become a global village with the same principles , so of course , the most intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you knew at the time in the village , who did what and when , this extension , this extension , this expansion of our self through these mobile devices .
it &apos;s that we know globally , they have knowledge and faster and better , and they have better .
the way it used to be on the village before .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been busy looking at what &apos;s going on , which is , because , of course , what we have , of course , is what we might have <unk> , which is also what makes the difference ?
because often , people are saying , you can &apos;t make it <unk> , so everyone can handle it .
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and it &apos;s not just changing that it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and when , of course , it &apos;s an intuitive thing , and how can i take a sense of impact on it and making things like this , that you &apos;re very intuitive , you know , because then they &apos;re getting fun and you &apos;re just going to use .
so you &apos;ve been engaged , too , as a student , with the subject of perception and <unk> .
and this is of course , of course , where you start and watch and say , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and what does it look like there ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re doing it ?
and what means , of course , what is natural , and how do we work our channels of perception and how does cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs has told you to <unk> you to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to make a little bit of a video or intuitively <unk> , which is called the core .
and you &apos;ve already seen that you have seven of our most seven senses , most people think we only have five , now , there are even seven <unk> , because it certainly is the near future of the next , eighth of the world , and also our self .
and look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what &apos;s information ?
information is any difference that makes a difference .
a lot of them use the word , don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
but i &apos;ve got to understand in the core , when you get information to information , when information comes from data and from information , so that i know how to do things like i can do things as well as i could , or intuitively .
and of course , how does design impact on perception .
so , we see this when i made things , then i can make them confused like the right side , where i don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can sort of paint it by showing you .
so , very much natural , in a gourd , but i can see directly where salt and pepper eggs .
and when i say to someone , you &apos;ll give me salt or pepper , and then you &apos;re thinking about where you &apos;re in your right first thinking , where &apos;s inside .
and in the left simple intuitive , i hope that there is no sugar in there that salt there is a sugar salt .
but also , our perception itself , how does they make us .
for example , this perception of context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just equal to the same big , and yet our perception , depending on what context we do things .
does anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should still work .
there &apos;s more of my glasses of mine .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
and a second circle starts to begin to relate to some resemblance or associate it .
and if i &apos;m still going to take a <unk> , we don &apos;t even see one more thing , and that &apos;s a circle and circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle .
it &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> , which also affects us in perception .
the important thing for the designers , the most part of the most semester , the great <unk> .
close to the closeness of the continuity and so on .
they already forget about the third .
but it &apos;s essential to be part of essential , if you just want to design things as well as the same thing .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting to see .
it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s so exciting when you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think , we see from the front to the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back of the back .
because it &apos;s an assumption in front of you that you can see something that you can recognize , the <unk> circle .
that is , we &apos;re just going to see what we see before we see it , and then back back to our <unk> <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i have a cognitive <unk> , you have what <unk> what you want to see .
that &apos;s where it is , then that comes back again .
and then again , it goes back to the front , because the back behind the front is not going to look at the front , and he says , right now , i &apos;m going to look at it , you know , if you see , what you want to see is what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , a whole , very energetic process , like some things happen and what &apos;s happening to these things .
i don &apos;t know who you know that picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now everyone from this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who you see .
does somebody see something ?
a <unk> , right .
if i &apos;ve seen that , that &apos;s there &apos;s a <unk> inside , you know .
you &apos;ll never forget , because i &apos;m showing you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , now you see it always .
that means , i &apos;ve actually eaten her now that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern <unk> , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short amount of time , to see that dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of vision , <unk> .
now , i &apos;m sure now , and now i &apos;m going to start to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , quite exciting , very exciting processes that then , yes , gray , you don &apos;t actually do , but there &apos;s a little bit of that here in this <unk> mass .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
if i know , it takes three seconds , until i sort of get out of the present , and i can bridge it from the present , and then i can bridge that very well , very well <unk> , which i always do with three seconds .
it &apos;s to process it as the present .
and then the past goes to the past , so i can bridge very elegant <unk> for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes an milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
that means , warning , if you know this now , you &apos;re looking at who you look like for a long time , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what can happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s what most of most perceptions we have .
that is , this first impression that happens in a fast fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we can also see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we kind of <unk> ourselves against our environment so that we can actually think about it as well .
of course , the creator is not only concerned with the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but naturally of course , with the subject of <unk> .
so , how does a human deal with some things .
there &apos;s <unk> , which is such a practical functions , so <unk> aspects or <unk> aspects .
there are <unk> where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s symbolic functions , why is someone for such a little <unk> , where doesn &apos;t it happen anyway , <unk> sums up money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
we &apos;re more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we are , of course , as designers , of course .
back to my actual theme , natural user interface and the subject , which is , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> always means how to make a certain goal very quickly , or how can a users be effectively effective in a certain amount of treatment , efficiently , efficient and <unk> .
that &apos;s the norm that it says .
how can i do something like this ?
can i be able to use that directly , or do i need &apos; n , or i need the training of the training .
and less <unk> or <unk> it is .
that i &apos;m just making it different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you &apos;re part of the software that we just saw , look at this , you &apos;ll also understand why <unk> percent of our modern software is little intuitive , or not available in many ways , which is <unk> in many areas or more optics , even though it &apos;s a lot more intuitive .
and this is an intuitive <unk> , not only since apple to be a elementary <unk> , <unk> elementary life , if i want to harness technology devices .
why ?
because , in the case , we &apos;re in the norm , through these new kinds of <unk> , the natural user <unk> , for example , are five times faster than the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic <unk> , you need five hours , and with this new kind of natural software just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours to go home , but then your employers or anybody will notice , you know , how to engage you with four hours .
but i want to say , of course , that , of course , it &apos;s a corresponding thing for us to do .
so if we go into the domain of the software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line interface that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next one that now came out with a <unk> model of a <unk> model , like the software <unk> , have worked , because you have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to harness the computers .
so no longer , and ones or <unk> codes , but a metaphor .
so that made all the way all the time , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works much more with behavior .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing as a creator , a lot more likely to behave than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
so , once in once , that looks at the success of the success , it &apos;s going to be an app .
and if i &apos;m going to take a step back to these natural user interfaces , where i am voice by voice , with language , by kindness , by gesture , and not more by mouse and <unk> things , i &apos;m still going to go faster .
but this brings me back to the point , but when things are actually more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here and look , what does this mean from view of the <unk> , when is really something that &apos;s really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us people is always an intuitive , if i have to think about it very little .
so he doesn &apos;t really want to think of it , but it &apos;s just going to make our standards .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
that means , if we look at the existing information technology from one else to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use this as a creator .
that means , i can put an intuitive , human computer system on software and make the software a lot more <unk> .
now , of course , the question , of course , is that what &apos;s actually the most complex <unk> of us people , and now i have now .
this is what we call <unk> .
this is using each of us and <unk> is an acronym , and it stands for orient , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
it makes each of you all the time , but it &apos;s unconsciously unconscious , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly , instinctively .
the model is already <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used for us all the time , without the most time , that the model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to 50 times the way in activity , so in sleep , you have noticed that it will be less often than a day .
i can now orient to this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> , <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of <unk> , now is now not a metaphor of a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of the classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and now , if i &apos;m going to <unk> this , for example , in which i can orient <unk> , <unk> as a choice , inform me , and it &apos;s coming up to me , i can look at it in the details , and yes , i can send it to someone or buy it somewhere .
then i can transfer this whole .
i &apos;m going to try it through a <unk> .
so everyone has been eating pies .
so speaking , i sort of interact with the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the entire overview , can now filter this on this , and say , just show me just for chocolate for example .
and once at once , a interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach things like the piece , and you can get it out to me , and they come to me , is much more natural than when <unk> organized websites or other mechanisms to sort of make these things available .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> , and with that phrase , i would like to close , a and again , to give the evidence , too , also designers , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to give you to a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one when you &apos;re a child big , as a baby , is that you care about what <unk> you have , yes , and depending on whether your parents allowed them to play more or less in the <unk> , and , of course , their curiosity will be immersed in it .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn to learn .
so all of them are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
now , i &apos;m going to use this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
and that &apos;s on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day , they give you scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to pick up two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we did not take phosphorus and make it phosphorus .
so amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re dealing with something , which is actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not like that .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only brought phosphorus for two years , and now we &apos;ve got a lot of more uranium in the world in the world of the world , as in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium are distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , get less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i say , <unk> your child , just blow it three times instead of five times .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about it from <unk> to <unk> , our entire earth will be back or later a <unk> .
that &apos;s how to think about the <unk> to <unk> .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground , first .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the cotton &apos;s stored .
so right now , we &apos;re building corn and <unk> between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or in the square meter also .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than a new form .
so , of course , we can actually look at the <unk> .
and it &apos;s all packaging , or content .
in <unk> , for example , <unk> percent of the <unk> are now <unk> .
and because we &apos;re getting older , it will be <unk> .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in <unk> .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand diapers .
so , of course , we could reduce it by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to this <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the way that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because phosphorus is going to be <unk> in the pigs .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s because that &apos;s what it is , right ?
traditionally we think of the <unk> , we are too many in the world .
and if you get to the people that you have to do it , when you say that they would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so , somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> to stabilize human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re <unk> a human life , you cut the earth .
here it says the more you eat , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we are .
i could use termites , but in the united states nobody doesn &apos;t like termites from so far as they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we are .
and because they &apos;re physically working much tougher than us , and because they live only three to six months , you are in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we wanted to do , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re at all of the earth , for example , you can see that for example , there &apos;s a program , for example , right ?
they can only be <unk> if they don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
once you saw a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means , our whole intelligence means that we want to be as a trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
thankfully not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still six billion billion trees alone .
now , you &apos;ve heard some of the <unk> of trees ?
that means , all of our intelligence means that we want to be as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , which is agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow agriculture to go back .
every year we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into these cycles .
and we &apos;re too many .
it alone .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they &apos;re all called , which allow our own <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to make sense to be less harmful in terms of health care .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a huge footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest , not there ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot themselves , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in where we regain the nutrients .
right , we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we take directly waste .
in china , a <unk> <unk> today is <unk> , and , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means all the western <unk> looks like that the city has always taken up , but the farmers have never returned .
and so the cities had to grow up , because the farmers were going to the cities , and the cities had to go away their nutrients .
so all of the western empires are always expanding until they don &apos;t get the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;re always able to get rid of nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you would expect to eat that it &apos;s staying until you get the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to be invited to eat them , not for the <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet how to get the nutrients back .
it &apos;s actually nice to do that , if you do that , so that agriculture does , in a hectare of country with five thousand people in favelas , can make a farmer for about <unk> dollars and wait a farmer for about <unk> dollars and waiting for a farmer and chickens and chickens and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and
and the great thing about this is that the middle of the favelas are back in favelas by three percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , so little bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , <unk> , but the facilities are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can simply farm .
so that &apos;s called the <unk> coming back .
none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities has ever been <unk> .
they could just <unk> a liter of <unk> , and then it would be ruined for years .
not .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , so little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what they want to do , they write in germany , in germany , the best good for all wastewater treatment wastewater .
unfortunately , unfortunately , they &apos;re not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the most <unk> a little bit .
because the <unk> plant might best get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s done .
we &apos;ve been used for three years now .
the dutch government has explained they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need the overall overall .
you can see , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that are controlling 40 percent of the u.s.
and the oil is to replace the oil that we can replace .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing kind of a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and , first of all , questions about what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , it understands that because in holland is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife is sad when you put them up , and you &apos;re coming up with the roses .
very inefficient .
but anyway , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , in germany , eats three pounds during their lives .
here .
this is not a scientifically not exactly right because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to do it .
but a <unk> , even in this illumination , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effectively , right ?
one thing that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not about resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better , and not to burn it a little bit , and you &apos;re going to lose all the materials for these kinds of materials , but first of the way to ask , how do you include these loops ?
think of mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i put them up for dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tablet with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not to avoid that , to reduce , reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have green to green in the south .
no , it &apos;s exactly the right thing , yes ?
in every place , where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , you get <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in the way we think of the north .
there is every footprint that &apos;s there .
when you walk , yes , every footprint in the ground is destroyed .
because the soil will die from these mosses , and the wind and the water washing on the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint , which is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , what &apos;s going on with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s the minimum .
so not saving , prevent , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you can see in italy , like the people in the high bow of this car , you get out of a car like this .
because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a <unk> form , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the real design , please .
so , for example , we developed a <unk> , which is a room room , in room temperature .
they can go to where they go and stand .
in two hours , it builds up everywhere .
and it &apos;s seeds of rare plants , so they do it by throwing it away to biodiversity .
that means we are useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two loops .
not everything should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using it , they don &apos;t use them .
only things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , which have to be like that they &apos;re going into biological systems .
the things that are just going to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
very direct advertising , not for the company <unk> , not for the company <unk> , but that you now help this company to succeed , these products now .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yes ?
so , when i put them up to the food and say that &apos;s free of <unk> , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we see what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
no toxic inside .
it &apos;s all in it , which is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can see the <unk> on the <unk> , and that rubber into biological loops , right ?
all of it is <unk> .
and if we manage to do , of course , it &apos;s for <unk> , for nike , for nike and <unk> and the textile textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the countries around the world that &apos;s caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you help them , ask people .
hey , <unk> , makes you really seriously ?
that &apos;s because they &apos;ve already changed the <unk> change now .
and i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m really sure it &apos;s really <unk> .
so help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what has been shown .
that &apos;s going .
we can do things now that if you look at it , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can do that in biological cycles .
the technical domain , the same thing .
there &apos;s a direct sign of this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made to go back into the circulation .
so , in any store , you can do things like this .
if you come to this , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> <unk> ?
when the moment is the trash .
it &apos;s everywhere there are <unk> , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the front door to the <unk> , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the change in biological systems , that they can just go back to <unk> , then you can see in israel or in tunisia to plant trees .
yes ?
alone , if you take these <unk> , you <unk> , sterilized and the powder in order to plant trees .
so this is the baby <unk> for all of the life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent it all .
i started a institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and you can all get involved .
there &apos;s extra charity , <unk> , where everybody can be involved .
no longer saving , prevent , reduce , reduce , not a <unk> , but smart waste .
does that be curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that i was as <unk> as a <unk> , so in the english of english .
<unk> are the translator &apos;s translator in <unk> music .
that , as a translator , you &apos;re not just sending word to a word for word text into a different language , but also to understand the deeper sense of words and <unk> , so that makes it meaningful translation , anyone who has to do it with <unk> .
to translate from the germans to english , more knowledge can take knowledge , because it &apos;s when you go to poetry or about poetry .
it &apos;s <unk> , but what we &apos;re doing with a musician with our <unk> .
i &apos;ve got just the first written of grades in a <unk> .
you think that the composer has <unk> into the notes , which he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
and these notes are about exactly the same way or <unk> , like a verbal verbal , but also very seemingly reliable , a landscape .
because in this case , the smell of the flowers is not smell of the flowers , the degree of <unk> is just to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , not to feel .
that means the interpreter needs to be these <unk> data from <unk> into another , namely , concrete , non-verbal <unk> .
today , i want to share with you what i &apos;m going to translate to a verbal verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
so i prefer to do all of the german , because if i had to translate it again to english , it would be equivalent to me in translation of the translation of translation .
so , the music that works for me is like spoken spoken language .
the <unk> grades have the type of letters of scripture .
so it &apos;s not going to be able to learn from listening to the keys on the piano or the right place on the piano .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
you know , the letter of the letters is , if you can do the language .
and so you need to use the learning process for at least as long as the spoken word .
and there &apos;s also <unk> if you learn it for the <unk> , just passively , or you can speak to the musical speaker until the musical speaker .
the work of the process starts similar to like a <unk> .
first of all , after you chose a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , first of all , you have the <unk> of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of the composers itself .
you study the works that he did before and afterwards .
you consider it .
the <unk> to write it .
how , what did he feel ?
how were his circumstances of how the society and politics ?
this is all interested in me .
you think of it in the time , by looking at contemporary images , for example , reading <unk> images .
but if you have time , as well as an interpreter , a rich way to know the composers that you play is that you play more and easier to feel it and feel it .
the composer is always becoming a friend that you live with .
his desire to write the piece is getting more and more to my personal concerns of playing it .
now , when the notes everything else is the message of the composers of the composers , it &apos;s just a scaffold , so i &apos;m turning to turn to this scaffold , to bring it back with meaning and meaning to meaning .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between that framework .
i &apos;m going to play <unk> what these sound could be .
now , for me , and for the composers at the time , and what i could mean for it for this today .
and every note , every note gets a sense of , because i feel it feels like it comes from my personal <unk> .
it has to be for me in here and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience to be my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert again , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve developed for so long in advance , how to communicate .
how you experience a happy new day , again , even though with the same rituals of life , you get up , you get breakfast , i &apos;m going to go to work , and i &apos;ll always get the same piece over again .
and again , i &apos;ve become a day older , changing seasons , my pulse goes slower than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer to come back at home .
i &apos;m going to take my breath true , you know , or unconsciously .
all this influences me , and all this influences me with the composition .
it &apos;s also wonderful , when i &apos;m standing on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and you &apos;ll get to this answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> , and what you can &apos;t do it is not samples .
it &apos;s great fun to make music , and they have experienced the audience as the audience , how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to be able to play more like this .
i can &apos;t play today in 20 years today .
and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> in my palette from emotions , emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a bunch of <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have <unk> , but it &apos;s new <unk> .
have a nice concrete example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> on my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and free professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young , so that he was already <unk> when i finally went to study .
but i was very lucky , it was very early at 13 years old , and i &apos;ve been to know , and i &apos;ve been on school on his school classes .
and i was 17 , when i went through one of his classes , and i went and played the last one by the four ballads by chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
this is such a <unk> part .
and in my graduate school , i said , expectation .
and he said , &quot; so ? &quot;
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already over <unk> .
well , with 17 , you still have dreams , but there are no major memories .
i &apos;ll play this piece for every couple of years , and i always changed it for me , even though not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of this is a very different area . monet &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , in <unk> light .
he &apos;s got the <unk> <unk> , and he has seen it as he saw it in this moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
i &apos;ve also been also older than the chopin with <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he was only living years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look back in the notes , even though i mean , you memorize .
to hold <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
most of all , when he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , it takes about just as long as the spoken word .
a lot of the time is that you just learn to read the note .
you know , you know , you &apos;re learning first to read before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes on the mouse on the instrument .
and then all of the fingers in time and all the way it stands to the notes , they come out of sound that sounds like music .
when it happens , the student gets the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s hardly speaking about the interpretation .
all right , there &apos;s a very rapid piece , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
according to <unk> , f and b , etc .
this is what most people know .
but even when you set up these data , it &apos;s still going to be something technical .
and yet it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget about something <unk> .
namely , that to make music on the instrument , to do your own musical and feel before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who hasn &apos;t learned the singing , because it &apos;s not <unk> the parents , it won &apos;t be doing it .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of the music to get it over another way , so about an instrument to sound the sound .
people who never sing , and they never felt immediately with your body as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the instrument of music is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it &apos;s going to be bored .
no longer needed to whistling , or singing .
every own music is going to be <unk> when you &apos;re going to <unk> from the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m asking , can you not sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to see if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to make these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , right .
because you can train it .
or c , because you &apos;re telling them that they &apos;re <unk> .
so , i wonder , how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
did you have a <unk> or <unk> , as you say today ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music , and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t want to do any failure .
but what i &apos;d regret before , because music is a nice , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can do it again .
well , you see , you don &apos;t have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , please , i don &apos;t know about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but i &apos;m sure you can tell you if you like , or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get to the food because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give them on classical music , because they don &apos;t have to play an instrument .
listen to them and tell you whether it tastes delicious or not .
whether the music is too sweet .
say what they feel .
and with the time , they also get standards , and you want a little bit more spices , or taste <unk> or taste even fine differences .
why is i challenge now from my audience to listen to it as well ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force to work .
the food that has been cooked by a cook or a chef <unk> has got to be eaten , not just or recipes .
so please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice motivator .
if in an environment , where the adults make active music , at least active music , a child is growing up , it &apos;s quite easy to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of a blue flower , was a blue flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
so that was the first beginning of a single musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written by a hundred , <unk> , <unk> , three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments are <unk> .
there was no piano at the time of bach as an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t yet invented .
i think that bach would have been excited if he had had the <unk> possibility of modern <unk> .
i can see the <unk> that the stream has had , on the modern wing , to the sound of the <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
i also know by beethoven , that he heard more when he had gotten deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from the time as a <unk> .
so the composers of us are <unk> to <unk> the pieces .
so they &apos;re audible by what they &apos;re just imagined in the mind .
and also what you would think of in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what is envy ?
were they <unk> ?
and how did it feel ?
suck .
i have a friend , who drives a <unk> .
now , if i come to my little v w , i &apos;m going to be wrong with me , that feeling is coming up .
let me take something through the head .
i say , &quot; <unk> , what need you need like this ? &quot;
that &apos;s the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why is i going to afford to do this , &quot; why do i afford to do this ?
and then i &apos;ll notice immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward emotion is away .
our organism has invented a great way to make feelings like envy simply to disappear .
you can also try it in words like revenge or <unk> or something .
now , i want to explain to you about this mechanism , or something about what you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie on the lie , as you may have heard them when people say , no one has to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he &apos;s looking at the point .
you see , on a lie , the liars will not believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it has very different in the sense .
it only makes them fool them and not itself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , they &apos;re talking about it , that they feel themselves .
they need this lie to get a <unk> to get a <unk> .
they can bring them less easy , yes , <unk> or down .
you need time .
this is an anecdote that you may know about .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once <unk> a woman .
this woman then complained that the portrait wouldn &apos;t look like this .
picasso goes , wait for only .
it &apos;s going to be more similar .
in this place , and when you laugh , you can see how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> ratio to lie .
the artist shared with you something , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see , if you just look inside the mirror .
the artist shares you in such a portrait of something that you &apos;re just going to be familiar with , if you look at this piece of artwork again .
then the awkward feeling disappears , and it wouldn &apos;t you look like it , and it &apos;s going to give you more similar .
so here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to <unk> our <unk> .
and not just in art , even in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories it appear again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning , and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much hostility from this true responsibility , the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true rule .
but we should just be familiar with that , so you can &apos;t tell a woman to say that there &apos;s a difference somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to be able to do under <unk> <unk> , again and again .
we need this kind of lie that we need to be the deception of deception without which we can &apos;t survive .
we don &apos;t just have the arts in the arts , but we don &apos;t just lie in science like this .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of people .
that the person of the monkeys should <unk> and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran into her husband and she said that &apos;s probably what charles there is writing .
human beings should be <unk> by the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people know about it .
why do we prevent people knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we are the self-deception , this feeling of being great , line from the highest beings , not from one of these <unk> , from such a <unk> , like an organism , like an organism , which is still like an organism like one of us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to prevent people about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly that mechanism dissolves and look like the traces of traces that he leaves on something else than this great image of us , i want to show you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she was told by a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to particularly , especially , because he has a propensity for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m in the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m in the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re <unk> in this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said to my wife , whenever a human being put in a moral sense , that &apos;s because we should try to replace it by replacing it by <unk> .
do that once , and then you get the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that this is the actual truth behind the world .
so a little bit of <unk> , which is not going to be interested in <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there are no clubs where we can look at where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second best thing , the fire fire .
and he signed up .
and <unk> , they also don &apos;t tell his teacher that you &apos;d like you to put fire in somewhere , and you &apos;d be excited when the fire afterwards .
no , it just looks much better , when we show that we are in charge of the risks that you can do , if you just put fire .
here &apos;s this little mechanism .
this <unk> that <unk> , in the heart of the <unk> , knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say it loud .
so here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious , which is immediately <unk> , without you can do something about it , and the things that you know about it is a very different way to be better for you and others .
so , just these words , these are just these words that we &apos;re also doing in the language of political correct politics .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know when we say this , the social story is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to give you the argument that we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after which logic , this <unk> , that self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones we already know in unconscious , they &apos;re valid to spread out .
here i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of you are familiar with , very few of you .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so <unk> , says leibniz .
it &apos;s something not <unk> <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people who have a strong belief that they own a soul , or you can also say that they have been resurrected by the soul , you think that it &apos;s like the soul of it , not like the soul of them , not from matter , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and from this soul , you think that they sort of <unk> in this <unk> nature , which is <unk> , <unk> , in the latin , <unk> , present , present .
and if that <unk> then goes over the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature , who can only live with a soul .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should perceive them as a bit of what &apos;s really to present for our life .
and if you have this assumption , you can see the logic of that , with which we experience this happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now they can apply a <unk> .
they &apos;re still familiar with school .
now , this is a <unk> that describes a logic .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but also to lie .
because to lie that you can just apply that logic just wrong .
in this case , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , he has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
and i highlighted him in particular .
and the third sentence that shows right now in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , who is dead , you can &apos;t claim .
and here you feel .
this is the logic of this , yes , in this <unk> speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they make sense correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic makes no statements about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a message about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the point is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says there is no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our consciousness feels immediately , and that &apos;s what you can do .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s as much as the opposite sentence has been proven , and assuming it .
because actually we would have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which is just using that two sentences are correct , and a third one that looks like this , as if it would have something to do with it , we can save our lives .
so , we do as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of this , and again , we have filling the filling up again .
now , this is another <unk> topic , a <unk> from philosophy , present .
it has to do with that , that we &apos;re going back into the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> called johannes <unk> , and after that is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you put the exact same in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a lot of it is to go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
this is how the <unk> presented .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> to each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so only if you get another example , if you get a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason , it doesn &apos;t need reason , and it doesn &apos;t need any reason to do it .
it comes into the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , and it &apos;s going to be driven , from the bigger pile , you put one immediately , you also have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re also in <unk> here in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> in brain science .
there &apos;s a <unk> , which is called <unk> , and you say , you know , wolf <unk> claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now , again , we can make the second sentence again , and we can say , if wolf is <unk> , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read almost a daily newspaper , they find that in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who &apos;s not <unk> , can &apos;t have <unk> for his actions and claims to have responsibility and claims is <unk> .
again , here you have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove to you to see if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do as if the first sentence of the first sentence is wrong , when you don &apos;t have to think of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to practice the <unk> .
do that , for example , if you encounter a person that you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
they cannot call them , that would be a little politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be one of the things that we have of course , of course , like this , experience that you can &apos;t prove that .
and already they have a problem .
because as you &apos;re busy doing it , that you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he got it misled .
it &apos;s because he has led them to a <unk> , which he doesn &apos;t slow down .
because in fact , this person doesn &apos;t really care about it .
he &apos;s just interested in being involved in the need to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the kind of shifting the <unk> , she &apos;s watching the brilliance of the lie .
and once again , once again , you have a chance to feel that <unk> to other people , they do it because they &apos;re going to make other people happy if you don &apos;t remember it .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve been allowed to ask <unk> if i can mention it .
it &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and told me if i wanted to keep a lecture here and my idea of giving my idea .
i have to be honest , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , it was hard to talk about my idea .
and may i think i might try to imagine you .
but it &apos;s of course the sum of the very many ideas .
i &apos;m an likely one , the two girls are still there , i &apos;m probably the generation that was made for this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve been starting to study engineering college , and today , i think , decompiculture , i think , decompiculture .
and i went back to berlin years , in the middle of the 80s , because i wanted to make renewables , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> , and the <unk> was called <unk> .
this is called <unk> .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or <unk> .
but kind of like <unk> , you know , a hundred watts out of the square meter -- that was a toy .
and in berlin there was a crazy <unk> .
and i &apos;m grateful that he has <unk> the word again again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word no longer because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t in the <unk> years .
and there was a little bit that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you believe the evil quo .
the place of <unk> , but it was called <unk> and has made wind and solar power , and i started out there .
and yes , a lot of what i said today is very , very , very much , because many , many beautiful expressions of it , i also have lived through .
i &apos;ve worked 11 years in the collective , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one of them has said no , it was a <unk> , which has been completely <unk> , and i &apos;ve been hard for 10 years , if i &apos;m really <unk> my great <unk> thing to a <unk> thing , because every colleagues of my father &apos;s hands always have <unk> .
it &apos;s preoccupied with insanity .
and it was really , very , very , very , very <unk> , and then you get into this kind of thing , that &apos;s a picture in <unk> , where i asked myself , after 10 years , there were a thousand <unk> , and , of course , that &apos;s what that really ought to be great .
and i went out to <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;ve become <unk> with friends , i &apos;ve got <unk> of the company <unk> , which was then <unk> by the <unk> <unk> of the world .
so , it &apos;s a <unk> , but we also have the problem of a growing company , and we then have <unk> , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start again and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what i think is going to be the same thing , and that &apos;s what i think
and i brought you a project i &apos;ve brought to you now .
and the title of talking was , you know , you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a relatively <unk> story , where if you could make a memory make sense of a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have an renewables for 15 percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
this is just technological .
when you get more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
i also always tell the politicians when they &apos;re <unk> our facility .
they always say , why ?
we have 20 percent in germany already .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our web is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we have the same problems that people have on this island there .
and the question was simple , it was <unk> , and the first contacts was started with the island , but it &apos;s just going through .
how big it would have to be a battery that you have to be like an island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go further .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , there are about a hundred <unk> electrical performance on <unk> <unk> in the world .
this is the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power power because this is very fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s going to be deleted with diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s going fast .
you put this on a box like this .
and then it looks like that in the rule .
they always run three of the <unk> , two will always waited .
yeah , it looks like this is the bottom line .
we also got very precise data .
and the <unk> or whatever it is , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system , which can only be <unk> in small quantities .
our goal was to just say , okay .
the diesel is going to be <unk> and the wind , the sun uses the burden so that they can map the bigger share .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the power of the moment , then they have to turn off the diesel .
that means , right now , you have to worry that the renewables can take over the entire network .
and of course , you can only be able to do that if you &apos;re there in some kind of way that you are there .
this has no one on the world .
there &apos;s a little bit of style , so you can also use your <unk> in the car through a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what are you doing in <unk> ?
this is all about .
but if you want to <unk> several of these <unk> , and they want to build a net , it becomes very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come up to 70 to three percent renewable , and then there &apos;s that rest here , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive , and it will not work that it &apos;s made of batteries .
this will be an energy fuel , which is then hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you or <unk> , that will be it .
and then they have to go to a <unk> and not just make <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then have a whole bunch of simulation .
and have wind and sun and the sun and the load , and came to the result , a very exciting outcome , that you need to take a middle <unk> of about 50 cents a <unk> a <unk> <unk> , about 50 cents a <unk> <unk> .
these were the first calculations of six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , as you can see , if you get five percent per year up .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what would you have to do anything ?
with investors , i was looking for new <unk> .
we were only only five people at the time to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s a representation again .
the brown is the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because that &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with diesel , and they &apos;re not <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> on the island , which is what we find .
and we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall hall in berlin , where we kind of can actually map the electric negotiations of the island in scale .
that means we were looking for first to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in this case of japan .
and <unk> , she said , in the &apos; 70s , the bbc in the &apos; 70s , <unk> <unk> , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it &apos;s got a megawatts of performance , and it can bring that performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we sort of have <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size the size of it , which is brought in the hall to actually the entire dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall , it looks like this , there &apos;s the size here , here &apos;s the big battery , which is the big <unk> that we can simulate the net .
over here we can simulate the whole thing over here , the <unk> of the wire to sort of map the <unk> on the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
so here we see this again here again , again , the diesel , and again , the whole one , single <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done , since <unk> , was done in the hall , so far , until today , all of the things that you &apos;ve got in between the single system of electronics to build on software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we &apos;re redefining as a company , which is only between the subject of the battery and the subject , and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to go into the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is , in this island , that , on this island , it &apos;s all the way that we &apos;re going to get , if we want to increase our levels of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back and forth at the moment , <unk> , like this , on the island , for example , to <unk> up to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
and then <unk> offers <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate the island on the island to be able to integrate <unk> , because you can manage the burden .
that &apos;s when you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through the n of n , you can take <unk> , yes , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to do the stake , you &apos;re never able to get on memory completely .
and that &apos;s the way you get the message .
so a lot of people are coming and look at this because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn rid of the diesel , you just have the spinning mass that causes a certain kind of inertia in the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just the amount of rotating masses of large <unk> , wherever the wave all around europe is spinning around .
we &apos;re looking at this web , and you see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s <unk> nine hertz , we start a few <unk> , then a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and then a little bit of a <unk> steam .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you take it somewhere , it takes a long time .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time you can respond to other things .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this spinning mass , you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can even <unk> two milliseconds in two milliseconds .
and then you see what enormous <unk> there is .
and the message is , well , we have to turn on this rotating amount of rotating , if we sort of <unk> our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 30 , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach that at all .
then we have to break down our <unk> capacity .
<unk> is simply called the power plant , to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a <unk> moment in the moment , <unk> from <unk> , because we don &apos;t do it , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to say that you have the capacity , the <unk> capacity , you can get electrochemical stores into the grid .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s also a lot of studies now .
and to that point , people are always coming and look at our <unk> in the way that we were doing .
and yes , the discussion is always about how far you can <unk> a piece of the future .
and many discussions that i had over the last six years was like the discussion that i had over the last 30 years , the subject of the last 30 years .
isn &apos;t there &apos;s insanity , <unk> , we &apos;ve never projected out there .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of that , over the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of <unk> store all over the world .
very simple , it will come .
there will be such a lot of <unk> and arguments .
and the beauty is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years that the scientists are going to sit on my side .
now , we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to <unk> .
this will take place in april .
so , you know , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just to be able to do that , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in arguments , there &apos;s always been trying to do these <unk> , which are <unk> , they have a little web that has nothing to do with our <unk> .
so the question is , very simple , if they &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or <unk> <unk> that are going to be <unk> anywhere in the world , and then you &apos;re an island , you &apos;re an island .
and then they just consume what the sun and wind is where they live .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said , solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in that , in that , the lecture of <unk> <unk> is that you &apos;re going to be a collective , and then use solar power here , a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you to be a little bit crazy in the sense that you can be quiet and have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite a lot of time , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , i &apos;m talking about los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , homeless who played on a violin , who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles on it later , a book , which was <unk> , was a book , with robert <unk> junior , when steve anthony <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> by the <unk> career and his promising career very early through his <unk> career .
nathaniel stepped juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you to read , or to see the film , so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was born between these two men , but also how the music makes that connection , and then the way the music was making that connection .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago in walt disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking in a very <unk> and <unk> sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about the way the dodgers never created it in the baseball world , and all of that because of the <unk> passage of the first violin .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , where i said that nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already used with electrical electrical and <unk> and handcuffed , a trauma that his whole life has done .
so , as a consequence , he &apos;s particularly prone to these cute phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he goes away for days to <unk> on the streets of <unk> row and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in the same way , nathaniel was when we started with our first daughters in walt disney hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how anybody wanted to poison him in the sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was frightened that i could lose it in one of his states , and i could sink his relationship to the violin , when i started talking about scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes were a complete shift .
it was like he was in the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding of a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , he started to play a couple of snippets from <unk> , and then i asked me to play them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , started from bach about beethoven , passed , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t only have a <unk> knowledge on music , but i also connected it to her with a very strong personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;d ever know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , was out of this <unk> , confused man , who just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in juilliard <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to think of his thoughts and delusions with the help of its imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so this is why we make music , so we can do something that is inside of us all , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually form our creativity .
and the reality of this speech comes all us , and moves , inspired and united .
so what nathaniel pointed , it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who realized his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m always going back with nathaniel music , no matter the walt disney hall , or <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i become musicians .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> stolen .
i hope you &apos;ll pardon me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was bred to be considered highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
and one day , the ceo of the company called up and asked if i could tell you a little bit about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become our cooks , how do we keep it on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve found the oceans as we <unk> forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;ve collapsed , they &apos;ve collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds is required to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
tastes very well too .
so here was a company that was trying to make it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow so far out in the sea , that you don &apos;t <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added to it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one ? what feeds it ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and i was in bed that evening , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t know .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t stop sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he won .
now , i &apos;m going to <unk> with a few people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally talk to the senior biologists .
we call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins are sustainable ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in terms of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what is sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i &apos;ve actually got <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god who tasted fish after that conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the better you know you know your fish , you love the fish .
i was first eaten him in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had talked about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came on the table with a bright , almost white white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can let you do so well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we call him <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he hasn &apos;t cooked this fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> on what was basically wetlands .
they did that by <unk> the land .
they built this complicated suite of channels , and they took water out of the land and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that that worked , not economically .
and environmentally , it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds that are many birds for these places .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company did bought the land .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally have the lever .
instead of using the water <unk> , they used the canals to get the water back again .
they <unk> the canals .
they created an extinct hectare of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company completely <unk> the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they &apos;re rigid on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> channels and this density , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of a croc of kissing . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , i &apos;ve got <unk> to my knees , and <unk> holds a <unk> .
here he lifts a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the characteristic of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundle that reminds him of <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> spent most of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he goes , and it goes into more talk about rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak with this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the street .
so i was interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it make your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what your fish eat ?
what is the <unk> ? &quot;
now he continues to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish were eating , the fish they would eat in the wild .
the dead biomass , the phytoplankton , the plankton plankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one of a farm belongs to their animals ?
and later a day , i went around on this site , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems as natural as any farm i had ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
now , the moment was , as if a director wanted a <unk> .
and we &apos;re bow around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker in the way the eye is just enough .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to birds .
well , last year , there were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it has become the biggest one , and one of the most important private <unk> in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t a very good job , not the last thing you want to do on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker of the belly the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this : a farm that their animals don &apos;t feed , and a farm that is measuring their success on their health predator .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , that <unk> from the first time is not even there .
they breed in a city there , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , you fly 240 miles to the farm .
and then every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> line of the <unk> line .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of trip of the penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly 240 miles to the farm , and then fly 240 miles a night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i quoted a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i did not mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m almost never cooking it .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in <unk> , you didn &apos;t tasted it at all .
she liked sweet and as if you take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> , and he mentioned <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last resistance to go into the body .
she has evolved in the process of evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added on it , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that didn &apos;t feed their fish -- a farm that &apos;s given their success on their success .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that didn &apos;t have <unk> , he <unk> it , because the water that comes through this farm comes in the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things , which is the rivers that tend to be associated with , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it fought through the system , and this leaves clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy ; it cleans water .
so not just a farm that their animals don &apos;t feeds , not only a farm to measure their success on their health , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , not only for those fishes , but not just for those fishes , but also .
because when the water goes down , it stays in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this story of love , like romantic , is also <unk> .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
so what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , in the foods .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you claim that these things are the things that the future is , someone somewhere on and says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how will they feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re going to produce enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed the world .
one billion people are going to starve today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because you &apos;ve got the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
feed in herbivores , <unk> at <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken in fish , and all the time the agribusiness just asked : &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the place . it was the business business business plan .
we should call them what it is , a craft in <unk> , a craft that enables fast to <unk> capital , which enables us to make this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
now , our health care today is not threatened by <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not using pumps , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , not by <unk> , not by <unk> , not by the forests of the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that can enable any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it , and it never made something really good for food .
but let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that for two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses , who are not worlds for themselves , businesses , instead of <unk> <unk> , businesses , as opposed as intense , farmers , who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the experts who are also experts .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to show you one thing today , the sum of the data that we consume , is bigger than the sum of their parts , and rather than thinking about how we can use information as we can use the information that we can use , and we see trends .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a particular cause of cause , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes you .
and that &apos;s because in the most active here , people are the most active , and they &apos;re at the <unk> over here .
we can step out one step further , and we can see the data <unk> and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we go on , we &apos;re going to tell 40 years or when we see that accidents is even the main cause of people to worry about people .
and if you see , you know , that &apos;s true for men .
so you can see that this is a lot of information and data very much in this way that it &apos;s in a lively stream .
and if we can make this for raw data , why not do content itself ?
so what we &apos;re now here are <unk> every single &quot; sport <unk> , &quot; which have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it after my lecture in their rooms .
they can live with <unk> in a decade .
they can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular issue .
now , when i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i click on this , and i &apos;m going to see all expenses on lance armstrong .
now , if i want to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and <unk> the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that when you plot up on this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to look or don &apos;t just look at it .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information is used .
so , i want to do this idea a little bit further , which is a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we took every single <unk> , and it reduced to a little summary .
the summary contains a short review and a symbol of the sphere you come from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the beating .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we &apos;re going to get a sense of the topics that are at the top .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
well , after i &apos;ve chosen &apos; government , i know that the <unk> that are most blankets at the age of <unk> &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that is not in a single field of activity .
this is only to see if you go back and look back and look at the whole thing .
... to a particular piece of summaries of this summaries , i can go into the subject of time &quot; people in the subject of time &quot; people , &quot; and all together .
so if i look at all of these individuals , i know that the majority are <unk> , some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono have a ted prize .
so we can jump down and look at all ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re surfing on the web for the first time it &apos;s really a network , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;m just showing you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can look at the web websites -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step back , and i can go directly to a specific dimension .
that &apos;s why that &apos;s important because you just look at the websites of websites in this way , all of the <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom into my course in a particular frame of time .
here &apos;s the state of the demonstration that i was holding up to this .
and i can sort of see everything i &apos;ve seen today , again .
and , if i step back and look at everything , i can rearrange my course , perhaps after my <unk> , and here , i went searching for <unk> &apos; <unk> , and here , after bing labs .
and from here i can go to the side and go back to you .
it &apos;s a metaphor that will always be used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn around this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we can start to go from many things to a lot of things , and then see patterns that would otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , this past <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , we can even pull out of it .
so i hear , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
i went to school with the bus , every day one hour every day .
and my nose would always put up in a book , a <unk> to hijack my thoughts in other worlds and <unk> my thoughts in other worlds , voracious curiosity .
this curiosity turned out that i was always when i was in school , walking through the forests of forests , traveling and <unk> &quot; samples , &quot; and snakes and bugs , and they looked at it and looked at it under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of possible exploration .
and my love for science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating <unk> , which were animals and places and a world full of wonders that we never had imagined .
and that &apos;s what i think that would be very good at that <unk> <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there was no video games with the <unk> film with <unk> movies , all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to read that at the time , when we read a book when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the canvas in our heads .
and my response to this was drawing and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all this .
i was constantly caught by the teacher &apos;s teacher as i hid in the outside textbook , <unk> .
creativity had to be out .
and something interesting happened . what was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , the idea of a completely unknown world on our earth itself .
i certainly would never know an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed quite unlikely me .
but here was a world that i actually could walk into , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all of the things i had imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to become 15 .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
and i didn &apos;t let me get out of that .
i mean my father , until finally he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in buffalo in the middle of buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that &apos;s now <unk> , i spent about three hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean of the ocean , is so rich in life as rich as we can &apos;t imagine .
nature doesn &apos;t know borders , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
to the day of days , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding on the same intensity as ever .
so when i was an adult for a profession , it was filmmaking .
it seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew comic books and so forth .
so films were the movies , images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i &apos;m looking at was the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; mate , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to connect my liking for the <unk> and building with the filmmaking .
so basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that is , we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we interfered on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
and then what was the first <unk> <unk> that ever looked like in a movie .
and the film didn &apos;t actually play any money , right , he was just playing his costs , but i realized something really fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> from the magic that ran away from it .
that &apos;s the law that arthur clarke &apos;s law may be <unk> technology and magic .
so you saw something magical .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it has to be involved in <unk> . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
and together , we created the guy from liquid metal there , and the success was all about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we created something magical . and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money with the film .
from those two experiences , a whole new world has been achieved , a whole new world of creativity .
so , i started a company with my good friend stan winston winston who at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> was called digital <unk> .
and the basic idea of this company was that the phase analog processes , with visual printers , etc . , to start with digital <unk> .
we then did that , and we did a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually started to do -- to slowly <unk> .
i had this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is written the stick into visual effects and <unk> effects in new heights , with severe human , expressive characters that were made , and the <unk> should be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but it put it back quite nicely , and the people in my company told me that we can &apos;t be able to do it yet .
so i shifted that and made this other movie on the big ship , which is going to fall .
and i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it became a <unk> of <unk> scale , a passionate film .
but i actually wanted to <unk> the real wreckage of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;ve convinced them by saying , &quot; we dive to the wreckage . we movies the real wreckage .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back back to this , that your imagination can create a reality .
and then we then created a reality after six months later , where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a tree .
this wasn &apos;t a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really blew me out .
and the amount of preparation on this were enormous . we had to have cameras and light structures and all kinds of things .
and i noticed , how much these <unk> , a canadian life .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> more sophisticated planning .
you go into this capsule , you walk into this dark , <unk> surround area where no hope is to save if you don &apos;t get back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , anyway , the part that has to do with curiosity and science , it was everything . it was adventures , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that had seen no one before , and for the science of the time we saw them , at all .
so that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted more .
and so i met an unusual decision .
after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker when a filmmaker put on ice on hollywood , and i &apos;ll <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to the <unk> , and we explored with <unk> .
we went back to the wreckage of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and looking at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
no one had ever explored the inner <unk> . you didn &apos;t have any means of it . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that are pretty similar , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
it &apos;s actually just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically present inside the titanic .
that was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i had a <unk> one , i knew what was going to appear in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i went through a <unk> when we did the film .
so the set was an accurate copy of the blueprints of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and it made me realize that you &apos;re using this <unk> that you use such a <unk> and your own consciousness into the vehicle , in that other form of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a quick view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> , which i can imagine as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started to learn what we saw down there , for example , like this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are essentially alien , but here &apos;s the place on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in the field of sunlight , the way we do that .
and so you see animals , right next to a 500 degrees celsius , they can survive there .
at the same time , i also became very interested in <unk> , which was back in my childhood again .
and so i ended up with the people who have been interested in space and who have to do with nasa and are sitting in the <unk> and right <unk> . they &apos;re going to go through russia , go through the mission , <unk> , <unk> , and let &apos;s go to the international experimenter .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took <unk> with us in the deep sea .
i took them with them , and i gave them access to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who have been interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to take samples and test instruments and test instruments and test instruments .
we were doing documentaries , but we were actually doing a lot of science , more specifically , <unk> .
so that closed the circle of my existence as a <unk> , as a child , and execution to reality .
in the course of this voyage , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , a director has to have to lead , a director has to be like a <unk> or so .
but i don &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what does i do ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t give us any money .
we &apos;re going to play the costs , and the fame is not trace .
everybody think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and would have <unk> me somewhere somewhere on a towel on a beach .
i have all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no privilege , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment that &apos;s there . you &apos;re going to make it because of this kind of weird connection , which creates a small group of people .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain any other thing .
when you go back to shore and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole way all the way , all of the technology , and the difficulty is working on the whole technology , when you &apos;re working on lake , , you can &apos;t just explain the other .
there &apos;s a link , a respect , mutual respect .
so when i came home to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you would respected his team and get their respect in return .
so the dynamics became really changed .
so , i &apos;m standing again with a small team on <unk> terrain , and we were on the avatar with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
an incredible challenge .
and we became a <unk> for a half and a half years .
and that changed my way to make films , completely .
there were people who thought we had really been able to have really good <unk> and transported to the planet .
for me , there was more a <unk> way to do my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all that ?
what are we learned ?
i think the first thing is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me that young filmmakers say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even have one .
put it for you . don &apos;t worry about yourself , bet yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in art , and to explore an alternative , it will not be an alternative , because there will be a <unk> .
no important endeavor of innovation , has been addressed innovation .
you have to be willing to take such risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to share with you with the way . failure is not an alternative , it &apos;s not an alternative , but thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may be surprising to me , because my <unk> in the foundation of the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , to make the things we invent and provide the poorest two billion lives to make .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> is not going to grow over many years , and it rain us too much , or too little . things are going to change how it can &apos;t withstand their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , climate change will be terrible for you .
it &apos;s also important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of price , energy would be far on the most effective way .
well , the <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid rapid <unk> case , and so we have refrigerators up , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s go in half the price -- we meet a new barrier , and this barrier is based on co2 .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
it &apos;s called the <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences to the weather , and perhaps worse , the <unk> that the natural ecosystems can not adapt to themselves and can &apos;t adapt to whole systems .
now the exact relationship between a <unk> and which is <unk> <unk> and where the other consequences are , there are some individuals , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly <unk> about how bad these are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
and i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we really have to go down to zero ?
does not matter half or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will move on .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a <unk> truck , which has to be under a three meter that has to be done under a three meter .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , we collide a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons .
every americans americans are about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of the planet on the planet .
and somehow we need to produce changes that lower it down .
it has been up to constant .
only different economic changes that are happening at all , and we need to go from <unk> increase in a reduction in zero to zero .
this equation has four factors , a little multiplication . they have this thing on the left -- the co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people that are on average , the average energy for every service , the average energy per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at each a factor of each one , and think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of those numbers have to get very close to zero .
now that &apos;s a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
today , <unk> billion people live .
and it looks at 9 billion <unk> to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines that are <unk> and <unk> , we could probably reduce it 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope .
the second factor are the services we use .
it &apos;s all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things , and <unk> means to make this service almost every on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do <unk> and use less , but on average , this number is going to increase every year and more than double and more than double the number of services per person .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s a very <unk> light , so you can read your homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in <unk> , through other ways of <unk> , through new ways of <unk> , there are lots of services whose energy benefits to 90 percent to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , like the manufacture of <unk> , 105 miles : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , or <unk> , is a lot more small for improvement .
in all , when we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by a factor three or maybe even a factor of six .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out , if you can get this to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every solar system for electricity today is co2 , except renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonder &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
normally there is no deadline , you know , you need a miracle to a specific date .
so , normally you &apos;re just wrong with just wrong and some of them .
but in this case , we have to give up <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really get this out ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that the idea of people here ?
i reminded me last year when i got mosquitoes and sort of liked it .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know there are people who are living with mosquitos .
for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that what was my <unk> contribution to the environment here is my <unk> contribution .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , you don &apos;t even want to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t all get much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have a unimaginable scaling and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i really see five that can afford these big demands .
i have tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels and biofuels .
they might afford a decent contribution , and if they do better than i expect to do , it would be great , but my statement here is that we have to go to all of those five work , and we can &apos;t give you a significant problem .
let &apos;s look at the burning burning of the fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you need to do there is maybe it seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to capture the co2 that comes from the <unk> , capture , capture under pressure and then store somewhere and hope that it stays there .
there are some <unk> that are going to create it for a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get to 100 percent , and one of them is a lot of challenge for them , and the biggest problem here is the challenge here .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee something about what literally many billion times larger than any kind of garbage you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough thing .
next : <unk> .
they also have three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , is high , and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human participation that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s what you should work on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve summarized .
it &apos;s the renewables as they are called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that these technologies are generating dramatically than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> times more than a normal power plant .
moreover , these vents are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always flow all the time .
that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have a way of trying to get energy in times if it &apos;s not available .
so , there &apos;s great <unk> . there are challenges about transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , it &apos;s not only technology , you need to be able to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from where .
and there &apos;s <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , looking for cars , computers , cell phones , <unk> , for everything , and i found that the amount of the electronic energy that we use now , and i found that all the batteries we &apos;re producing are less than 10 minutes .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources about we say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to rely on 100 percent on it , you need incredible <unk> .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project , &quot; how do we get to the goal ?
what we need are many companies working on this . hundreds of them .
in any of those five areas we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people involved in this .
bill size has several companies , including one called <unk> who has great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies that make great things and interesting opportunities and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i finance a company , which may be surprisingly , to follow the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
this industry stopped in this industry a few times , so there &apos;s no great surprise that some good concepts lying lying around .
the <unk> means that , instead of one of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never have a sensible way to simulate if it would work , but since then there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , yes , with the right thing , it looks like that .
and because it burns these 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today as a <unk> .
instead of breaking your head , they &apos;ll just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is being used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; <unk> wave of reactor . &quot;
you really solve this .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the u.s. economy <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts we need to get forward .
think about how to measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to reach , and then we &apos;re talking about the <unk> .
many talking about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and there &apos;s still something agriculture , hopefully it will clean up and cement cement to it .
so to reach that 80 percent , the industrialized world , including countries like china , completely reorder .
the other note says , if we use the most complex technology , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key feature of this .
if we go back to the way , what should the 2020 be testimony ?
there should be the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to get reduction in the way , the less we &apos;re going to be more likely to be more likely to be the <unk> and the temperature .
but actually , this note is for the things that we are doing , which is not completely important to the large <unk> , just the same , or even a little bit less important to the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
and we need to track these breakthroughs with <unk> and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this subject .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> &apos;s called <unk> energy . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework that can be discussed in the way , because we need support for all sides .
there are some things that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very bad wish , that we make this technology .
if you just take me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and that love me , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , i would take this wish .
this has the biggest effect .
if we don &apos;t get that desire , they will be terrible between the long and in the <unk> people , between the united states and china , between the poor and rich , and almost all of these lives are going to be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to apply to more research research .
if countries like <unk> meetings , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should discuss these <unk> , and they would be shocked from the ridiculously low money that &apos;s been spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , and we need co2 , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue and we have to have dialogue , and also the things that are being done by the government .
it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works reasonable , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> of the first place to find another billion , which is actually building the first of it .
when the first thing is done , when he promised , then it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density , is as different as <unk> as we know it .
and to understand the right thing : that means building deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column nuclear <unk> , using this <unk> , and then the process starts moving , and then goes on to bottom ?
<unk> : right . today , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor , so there are lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it and do things like it , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that they bury , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which gives you a solution to the waste .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the trash : you can let him sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- you take him and put it in the next reactor , and you &apos;ll put it in the next reactor .
and we start by taking the trash that already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in these reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so what these reactors have is a problem with what &apos;s a problem that we fill in our fill , and that &apos;s going to dramatically reduce <unk> in the process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people of this world about these opportunities .
where is the biggest interest in which it really does ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t been determined yet in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting things for all of the &quot; nuclear &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; in the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company in russia were in russia , india , and talking about how it fits the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variant of a thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody who has a fast reactor has a <unk> for our first .
in your mind , timeline and probability really are really asking to life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent for 20 years .
so this is sort of the deadline that the <unk> has demonstrated to us .
and , you know , <unk> , when everything is going well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could keep it easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies that , as well as their approaches , working for their pilots for their pilots .
and it would be best if it could do several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the major possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a fluid , which seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what we say about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty of it is that a million times a million times has a lot of energy like one , say , a <unk> , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mostly the radiation , the impact on the country and the most common .
if it doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we come together to try and keep the stable stable ?
<unk> : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve eaten too much , and just before you have a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> that deals with various techniques to <unk> warming , so that we would get to <unk> 20 or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you know , you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance , because you may be lazy to do that , so that you &apos;re going to keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save a <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you get the importance of this problem in front of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you have to have that available if things come faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , which is there &apos;s an opportunity in a million .
the <unk> here is just like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you just have later -- and that comes to the investment that the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc don &apos;t necessarily report the worst , and there &apos;s people in the rich world .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and then the co2 goes away , then the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that , i wish it &apos;s cheaper , but i wish it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other targets that are fighting for malaria , the <unk> that are fighting by malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources that we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- it &apos;s not so dramatic .
they don &apos;t want to suffer from other things .
you get to a lot of <unk> , and you can disagree with reasonable people here , if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and trying to fund that . for me , most of a waste .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of you , and we just funded the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much less expensive .
if the <unk> you get , it &apos;s a very high <unk> , you can only get the rich up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing your lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about it .
his new computer system is now : &quot; why is the research not going to talk more ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the <unk> associated with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to get the <unk> .
and this is one of these things that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little as being supported .
bill , i think almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> suggested a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> , the highest possible structure of the structure of 20 spaghetti , is about three feet , about three feet and building a meter .
that marshmallow has to be on top .
and even though it really seems to be really hard , because it &apos;s actually really hard to work together very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world , with students , innovators and architects , even with <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task , which enables depth to the nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them with you .
normally , most people start to orient themselves on the task .
you talk about it , what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
and then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . it shows and put spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> structure .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , you take the marshmallow , and you put it gently up at the top , step back and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; they admire their work .
but what &apos;s happened , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> causes the whole thing to bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; than others , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
you lie , you &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused , and make really <unk> shapes .
and , of course , there are teams who have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; and under the best are new graduate students .
and it &apos;s quite amazing .
as we told us peter , they don &apos;t only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the kids have spent time to be in the head of spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that they were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then we then realize it .
so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s going on differently is that they start to start with the marshmallow and start building prototypes , you know , <unk> prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have a way of fixing prototypes prototypes .
<unk> , this kind of collaboration as a nucleus <unk> as a nucleus .
and with every trial , the kids get instant feedback , which doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , which is significantly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams do .
the average average is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , a little bit more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , the key to build robust structures .
ceos are about average , but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
put an <unk> administrator on the team , they &apos;ll make significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
they can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they run the process , you understand it .
and that team that <unk> and <unk> in the work will make significant improve the performance of the team .
specialized skills and <unk> and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams , you get about six , the robust structures .
i was going to try something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s get the <unk> .
so i offered a $ 50,000 prize in software for the winner .
what do you believe in these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built high construction , he would have worn the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high levels have a strong effect ?
we went through these practice with the same students .
now , what do you think ?
now , it &apos;s the advantage of prototyping .
this is the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest apparatus in the time .
so there &apos;s <unk> lessons for us , about the nature of happiness and success .
you may ask , why would somebody actually invest in a <unk> ?
the reason is , i &apos;ll help digital tools and processes to help teams to help teams to create cars , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> does is they help you identify hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or position to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in <unk> can go to <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples from all around the world , how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we have all of our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking more optimal , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies before us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that it needs to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so as we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t be in the right now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america addiction to the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re sort of drawn to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because there &apos;s no way that options don &apos;t go back on this planet , go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time ever on this planet , no matter what scale it is : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> died all died than they were 60 .
my grandparents took this number on <unk>
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there was better one nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born today in new delhi can expect as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> . pop .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of millions of us have yet threatened by one generation , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try things , see if it works , change if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people on the world every day is going to go to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it rises very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash the world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also disappearing .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the land that they live on , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , this is not a <unk> .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m awake at night , we never need it as well as now , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never
and we were also able to be able to make it reasonable , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the cusp of the threshold , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think we have a hundred , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we have a time where we have progress on these things , more than now .
people are spreading out in front of their belief and so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right to think of his mind , even a right to think of it .
but you know what they don &apos;t have ?
they don &apos;t have a right to your own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was astonished to stumble upon resistance , towards the opposition of what the most effective activity in the history of human health is in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did , so i just do , i wrote an article and drove on .
and soon , i wrote an article on genetically engineered food .
the same thing is only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were going on one particular rather than a random form of <unk> .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but that article me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because those fanatics who were doing me crazy at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that brought me into this ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as we used to do .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic with little quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s reasons that are reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , they have lost , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they would be right . be skeptical .
ask questions , you ask evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything .
but now , if you get to the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that , from the reason , we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i never saw , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story has published a terrible story , which is a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very frightening .
tons of studies were done to see if that was true .
tons of studies should be done ; it &apos;s serious .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all alike , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we see , what makes you feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i think that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
disaster disaster for the fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where it goes down for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because does somebody have measles ?
has one in the audience ever see somebody dying of measles ?
not very often happens .
happening in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
these are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can put it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and get messages from fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king .
and they can do that because they can &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
it <unk> us from one of the worst human survival .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , pop , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a <unk> with some other people .
it can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except for paul &apos;s walking and talking about vaccines , saying how valuable you are , and that people should just stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he does .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul &apos;s talking to a public health clinic , he can &apos;t tell <unk> sentinels .
he gets phone calls at home because people like to tell him where his children are going to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , they return the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we have measles in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
i wrote a couple of weeks ago a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
nobody has said that ever before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against <unk> . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe i &apos;m going to get somebody in lagos tomorrow in a plane , and you &apos;re going to los angeles , right now , in the moment , in ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands a car and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know it , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t you pretend it &apos;s not .
we love ourselves in lying . we love that .
have you all taken their vitamins in this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you along .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half of americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars in dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re running away from , and where do we run ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it &apos;s really serious , because this stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , <unk> , and i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars ; it &apos;s a cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream up and say , &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s do people what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you &apos;re going to go on this way of thinking and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths deaths in a country that gets worse than any other one of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every <unk> , was changed by people .
you know , there was no paradise of paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked and some of it .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specifically . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to increase their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say i don &apos;t understand .
we reject altered food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies own seeds .
and do you know what my answer to all that is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of being a real <unk> , and it holds millions of people from human flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like cassava , cassava .
cassava is something that has been eating half a billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a ton of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this one .
and then people might be able to eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t be starving , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones to insist on greater food , better food , unprecedented food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do this , we kind of guilty about what we do , i think , not guilty , not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our not worthy , and we have to really stop that .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway , i &apos;m going to do that anyway .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this time machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we will move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time time time , we will be happy in the future to have done this .
i know that we can , and as far as it is me , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , and it may seem weird that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it as a &quot; an illusion that will be something real , if somebody believes it . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have been shown in a few studies a measurable impact , the <unk> , and it &apos;s because that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to you is a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , a measurable effect in the body , for example .
a deception becomes something real because somebody perceives it .
so we &apos;re also going to show you another , so i want to show you a basic , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been at least since the 1950s in each school of children .
i even learned it from the <unk> <unk> magic in the 1970s in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my hand .
i push my sleeves .
and to make sure that none of my sleeve disappears in my sleeve , i &apos;ll just get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything , as long as i can get nothing in my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand up , and hopefully , when everything goes well , the knife will put the knife through my naked physical magnetism .
in fact , in fact , it &apos;s in the place that i can shake it unless the knife fall .
nothing goes to my sleeve or come out , not <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often have young children who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
you know , many of you know here in the room .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m looking at my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears in my sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m looking at my wrist is that the secret of illusion is the secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i &apos;m looking at my hand from you , you &apos;re looking at it from the back , this guy moves here , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position where it was so <unk> .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone who &apos;s got no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i zoom in , the fingers changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception of why you don &apos;t recognize that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes to information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but that &apos;s not the point here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by looking at me , it &apos;s hidden through this movement that the finger <unk> again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can demonstrate your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with this <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really did my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
this is what it turns out : if they provide a placebo placebo pill in a white pill in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you can change the shape in which they will change the placebo against a smaller pill , and you color that blue and color a letter on it , you actually can measure it .
and that , although none of them are -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all about it .
if you take capsules , it &apos;s more effective than pills , every shape .
a colored capsule , which is yellow at one end , and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the dosage also plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that also plays a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance you injected a patient .
it creates a very strong image in the head . that &apos;s a lot more powerful than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector of this .
so the fact is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , which is not as good as a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem as well as the needle .
and none of it has any really profound property . it &apos;s just our belief in which we have a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m taking something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and i &apos;m really making it look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach to the needle , if it &apos;s supposed to go to it .
this is an <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;ll first get a little bit sterilized .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special set of hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to stick on this needle into my skin and push through them until she put it back on the other side .
if you &apos;re nasty , if you drop out of it , i showed this a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman nearly powerless .
so i propose , if you get bad , you &apos;re going to go away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive thing in the back .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see if you want to .
so , it goes like this , right here where my flesh begins , i &apos;m going to just get a little <unk> on my arm .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
we &apos;re actually in the same situation in the same situation we had at the same time .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah , yes .
i know what people think if you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid , and <unk> himself your skin , just to talk a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back to say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the <unk> are coming in .
so let me show you from nearby .
this is really my skin . this is not a special special effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
sorry . if you get bad , look away , look away .
the people in the back or the ones that later you see on video at some point , will say , &quot; well , it looks quite impressive , but if it was real , he would see -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and it really , if it really was real . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
i usually would take the needle off now .
i would clean my arm clean and show them that there are not wounds .
but i think , in this frame , and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle there , just let the stage just go .
we &apos;re going to face a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re excited . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people counting the number of books that are published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the past five years , and they gave them to about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are multiple cognitive ones , which it &apos;s almost impossible to do , very impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly being <unk> by these cognitive forces .
this is true for <unk> who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as mess as anyone else .
the first one of these traps is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out the word happiness is just not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could limit it , but in the big and large , this is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second case is <unk> from experience and memory : basically you are between happy being in his life and happy to be happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects the well-being without any meaning to warp .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who reported a story . &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was absolutely beautiful music .
and then he added to it , really quite emotional , that has all been ruined .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had a <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was with a memory ; it was memory , and that was reminded me , and that was memory , everything he had .
what that really says is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two species of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present , and the presence knows , capable of experiencing the past , but basically only the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , the doctor &apos;s office -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt , &quot; does it hurt . &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our life get upright , and it &apos;s that the physician appeals to the question , &quot; how did you feel lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot;
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two to be part of the <unk> of happiness is about happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re allowed to keep with our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that perform a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not even painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds on their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who of both have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has no more suffered . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had a <unk> , <unk> , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients had a much worse <unk> to the <unk> .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because it &apos;s a very critical part of history as it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is significantly worse than the other .
and the thing that is worse was where the pain was at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing all about ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from view of the <unk> self , b has clearly been an worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient a <unk> , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been made , and it &apos;s done , you could actually use the <unk> of patient a increase in the lab without just rolling up the tube .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have a difference that the <unk> itself is a worse on it , and you have a difference that the <unk> itself is a much better on the side , because now you have given a better story about your experience .
what does a story come from ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that makes us memory , and it &apos;s also true of the stories we invent .
and what a story is <unk> changes , significant moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , <unk> .
well , the <unk> self lives his life .
it has moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve done this -- you know , the psychological presence of the very presence of about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a life , and there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave behind .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you kind of get the impression that you should count that what happens during this moments of the world &apos;s life .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we use as we are on the world .
and what we would use it would seem to be important , but this is not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
from view of the <unk> self , when you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
it doesn &apos;t work at all .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> vacation is barely better than the <unk> vacation , because there are no new memories .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a <unk> self from a <unk> self , and time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more and to remind stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , we have two different surgeons at two different surgeons , and decide what to vote , then that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s thought that it &apos;s that much bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experience . we choose between memories .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as an adolescent memory .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self , and you can think of the most important self as one , which is sort of <unk> <unk> by experience that the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t need .
i have the impression that when we &apos;re doing a vacation , that means we &apos;re doing on vacation , in the service of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do about our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about this , i think about a vacation that we &apos;ve done a couple of years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think rather often in relation to how many times i think about .
and i probably have my memories of this <unk> journey , i &apos;d say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 pictures of this , i &apos;d spent another hour .
now that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s just a year and a half .
there seems to be an disagreement .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , like little appetite i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you make a real question , why do we give a real weight on the weight of the weight of the weight that we &apos;ll give you experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> , all of their images are annihilated , and you get a <unk> drug , so you &apos;re going to remember anything .
well , would you choose the same holidays ?
and if you would choose a holiday , conflict between their two types of self , and you have to think about how they choose that conflict , and it &apos;s not obvious at all , because if you think about time in the sense of time , you could get another answer . and if you think about your sense of memories .
why we choose the <unk> that we choose is a problem that we have in terms of the two species of self .
well , the two types of self , two words of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of happiness itself over time .
if you ask about happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how satisfied or enjoy the person , if that person thinks about your life .
very different term .
now , everybody who &apos;s not going to screw these terms is the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , which blew the exploration of happiness in the same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self , and the satisfaction of the <unk> self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure them .
the gallup organization has a poll that has been asked for more than half a million people asked about what they think about their lives and about their experience , and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years we started to learn about the very happiness of the self .
and the main thing that we do believe is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone &apos;s life is , and that &apos;s not a lot of how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you hit somebody and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you would know something about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
so if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is determined .
we know that money is very important , you know , things are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but it &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
so the implication of what i said here is that we &apos;re really not supposed to be able to think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same thing when we think about life and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people have to be happier in california when you say , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , let &apos;s say , climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people could pull to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people that pull into california in hope to be happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be thinking about how terrible the weather in ohio was in ohio , and you will feel that they &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that that gallup survey came out .
is that something that you can do with because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup survey in the gallup survey is a number we didn &apos;t expect .
we found that in terms of happiness in the happiness .
if we were looking at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under the income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s about a large representative sample , under one income per year per year per year is income per year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappy , the poorer they will .
we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw as flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t raise a <unk> , but that lack of money is certainly miserable , and we can measure this misery very clearly .
in the sense of other self , the <unk> self , they get another story .
the more money you are <unk> the happier .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , all the american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all the head , everything we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is going to be able to take a <unk> like this , and do based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s credit for the role of politics in politics .
the recognition is slowly going to be in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. it &apos;s happening right now and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
people are about to acknowledge that they should be thinking of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study <unk> or whether they want to study <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> yourself or whether you think about the <unk> yourself .
it will influence politics , i think , in the next few years .
you know , in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two , is part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me to be this subject , or should at least be the most exciting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to save the world in reality , how it &apos;s to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including you all , getting to play more time with playing games with games .
currently , we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we desperately have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most important problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase the time dramatically .
i calculated that it &apos;s going to be at 21 billion hours per week .
that seems to be the first thing that seems to be <unk> , so i repeat it so that it can work : when we are problems like hunger , poverty , climate change and obesity , i think we need to solve games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i &apos;m really kidding .
why ? this picture is quite exactly why i think games are so essential for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of playing , and so he was building a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you might get some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also <unk> concentration , and just deepened into the solving of a really hard problem .
if you &apos;re going to play , you see some nuances here who &apos;s looking down , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the brow are showing surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of something called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so good . so we have a number here .
an <unk> victory is a result , which is so highly positive that they didn &apos;t even know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and when they reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually capable of being able to actually be able to do . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is short before a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces around the world , if we take the barriers to attack the next century , the face of those who face all the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i am , like i &apos;m in life , i &apos;m bad in life .
this is an graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was looking at what we &apos;re doing in my ph.d. why we are better than in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think that we are not as good as playing in play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s one .
we reach more and more . i &apos;m talking about the motivation in the context of the motivation to do something <unk> , inspired to each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think that many of us are going to turn into our best version , anytime and immediately , to try to solve the problem , try to try and try and try and try again .
and in reality , when we run into obstacles , when we run into obstacles , we &apos;re often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel humbled . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings never , when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a student .
why is it possible to be impossible to think , you could not just reach anything ?
how can we take these feelings from playing into reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to collaborative solving .
and i found some things , the epic victories in <unk> as possible .
so , first , if you go into one of these <unk> , especially at world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to <unk> them a <unk> mission , and immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level , right ?
so you can do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to work , but there are no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re <unk> , and there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy life in real life , that sense that in a <unk> crowd , there are plenty of staff .
and there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high , &quot; &quot; + 1 , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i &apos;m not going to talk to this : plus-one crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be so satisfying , anytime , on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we would rather spend all of our time in this <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> have spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , <unk> million years ago , we started to walk upright at our first <unk> .
so the first <unk> primate .
ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we &apos;re currently playing with play , it makes sense when you think about the scale of human development , which is extremely extraordinary .
but it turns out , it turns out , because it turns out we &apos;re using this whole time on play , actually change what we are in the situation .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative beliefs , very much .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
look at this interesting statistic , which was recently published by a researcher at carnegie university , which is the average boy boy from today in a country with huge <unk> , with a huge deal of time with <unk> .
so 10,000 hours is an incredibly interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours are the exact same <unk> that they spend in school from fifth school to the high school degree -- if you never miss .
so , here we have a complete tour line that young people learn as learning what it means to be a good player , as anything you learn in school .
and maybe some of you may have a new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of science that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of any subject to the 21st of age , we will be able to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what to do as the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are the players doing ? &quot;
because if we could find that , we would have never been able to have a zillion human potential .
so many people are currently living in the world at least one hour per day at least .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> evolved <unk> that save energy and work on <unk> , rather than <unk> , with a player around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you &apos;d expect one extra player in the next decade .
that &apos;s a total of 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to master these games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine that like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to be able to do immediately , in a way , to master , together with believing that we have an educated hope to succeed .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and the same thing .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show you people like that , after we played with them , even if they defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with somebody .
we have trust that somebody has to spend time with us , that the rules are going to be able to make the rules that we have the same goal and stay with the <unk> .
so this allows you to grow the <unk> of ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours is playing 22 hours per week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard , when we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re optimal , if we do hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic significance .
players love to become part of <unk> <unk> missions .
this is a <unk> to put this on the right light , you know , all of the wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest weapon of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet of warcraft than any other subject in any other wiki of the world .
they create an epic story .
you create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome , players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to become the witnesses of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is clear by an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i am -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says that it makes sense because players can reach more than in real life .
they can make them engage in playing stronger social ties than in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in real life than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely obvious that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , <unk> . you know ?
there was <unk> <unk> .
and these were sort of the first of people we developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you may know this story . the story of how games were invented .
they were <unk> , more specifically , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> during famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of <unk> decided to be a crazy idea .
people suffered . the people fought .
it was a extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and a national strategy , a national strategy , and a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and <unk> us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to that , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating this famine , eating them on a day .
so , i think , let &apos;s take a play today .
we have a games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we use games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need to play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
so , according to 18 years , the famine wasn &apos;t better after 18 years , so the king decided to be an last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom of two .
they were playing a <unk> , and the best was to break the best to an adventure adventure .
they were leaving <unk> , and they went to search for a new home , and they just had so many people back to how it had food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of an area that they could flourish .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> shows that the <unk> , which is the fall of the roman empire , the same dna like the old <unk> .
so scientists recently came to think that <unk> &apos; crazy story came in .
and geologists found a world of a global <unk> that took almost 20 years of what the famine might explain .
so this kind of crazy story could be true .
you might actually have saved their people through games for 18 years in games for 18 years , and then they had a lot of things that we learned about with each other , that they saved the entire civilization of civilization .
so we can .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years of warcraft .
i want to argue , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be able to get half an hour of play a day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world problems in the real world ? &quot; and exactly that question i &apos;ve been doing my work in the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto that we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best possible outcome , and then people will empower the idea to make this idea into reality .
we put epic wins , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to give people epic victories in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> to make it realistic for it , and they actually live your real life without oil , so if you sign up to play , you &apos;re going to tell you where they live , and then you get <unk> in real time .
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years since .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how they survive , most of our players have maintained the game in the game .
so , we have a greater <unk> game for the nearest <unk> game , as just as <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game called <unk> at the institute for the future .
the starting point is the computation of a sense that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to player , you know , we have <unk> , we have <unk> <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where there &apos;s the &quot; <unk> . &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our task to create the future for energy , food , security , security and security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
and they found 500 creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> &quot; .
and the last game we &apos;ll get out on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you end the game , they get the award for the world bank , the <unk> of the world &apos;s development , in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa and invite to learn a social redesign .
we have a comic comic book . we have a level high to understand &quot; level high , &quot; sustainability , vision and genius .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all around the world , especially in <unk> , which benefit themselves , to help themselves their own social enterprises , to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you will agree that the players are in real life , and that games can have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve all got these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make strong social nets , <unk> and desire for <unk> .
i really hope that we play together significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play with me .
when i go back to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create any future imaginable , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s get the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what a few months ago when i was writing a article in writing a article on wired magazine .
i &apos;ve always been able to write my <unk> right now , but i was working with the edit of text , and i noticed that i never <unk> in my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> : <unk> , helpless , perseverance , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , strong , sensitive . &quot;
i read that list of a friend loud to the first time , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up with &quot; up , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t get to read , and they had to take me back after this <unk> and emotional shock . &quot;
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that the issue has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i started to rebuild elementary school , and i started to build my sense of sense of understanding of my family ecosystem and the way in terms of other kids and the way around me .
and god , thank god , i didn &apos;t use <unk> .
if i &apos;m serious about taking this point seriously , i was born in a world that someone would perceive as a person whose life can be positive in any sense , whose life can be positive , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunities and the adventure .
so , i immediately have to tell you about the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected me to find a <unk> contribution .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not much better .
in particular , the last two words are called me under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we think about with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our minds and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , really believed that the pronunciation is a great force because what you &apos;re noisy and <unk> can be <unk> .
so , what do we really want to do -- one disabled person or a powerful person ?
just to say a person alone as a child , it might be enough to reveal and <unk> them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open up doors ?
a man who opened for me doors was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t tell correctly , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. used to be very colorful , and it was just made for the work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to be repeating the individual <unk> , with this thick , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know to build my <unk> , and i hated these tapes more than anything else . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine , i &apos;ve been able to negotiate with dr. p. child with dr. p. , and so i tried to stop this exercises , <unk> without success .
and one day , he looked at me in some of my practice -- these <unk> were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll give you one day one day .
and when you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the exercise that i didn &apos;t want to do , with my vision , that five year-olds girls were going to be in the second floor , but he was actually brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes .
and i wonder today , how much his vision of me as strong and <unk> young girls have shaped my sense of self , and i could imagine myself as one of nature from strong , powerful and <unk> human .
this is just one example of many , like adults in <unk> the imagination of a child .
but as you &apos;ve already proven to prove this out of <unk> examples , our language doesn &apos;t give us a space to imagine what we would all want to do : it would enable each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
our language is caused by the societal changes , which caused in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for aging body , which allow people to use , really , to use their ability to use their ability to use their ability to use their own natural fate .
so maybe this is what you see in this technological change , because the fact that there was a different truth , which is that every human society can be something very low and very powerful , and the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i was <unk> with <unk> and i &apos;m going to say something to me , that sentence has never been <unk> , and i &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with the questions of people to answer the questions .
that sentence from how to deal with <unk> lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without the associated experience , as if my life would be so successful , because i could perceive me the way my life was so successful .
but the truth is that we are changing , of course , of course , by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally , and the both is both .
and i would argue that it &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to be able to do better in order to make our lives better .
<unk> are easy to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s barely present , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the effect of the effect of the impact of a human being .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real , and every person is about it , but the question is not whether we can &apos;t come with <unk> or not , but how we get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that , the people that we love to preserve <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re also preparing to be clear .
and we don &apos;t like to do our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to realize two things : one of the medical , and you have to be amputated , and to the other hand , i think that i am disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and <unk> disability , which i had to sit apart with , is that the world is constantly able to describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are at the heart , and they &apos;re going to be the cold , tough truth about their medical health , or even a forecast of the quality of life that you expect , we have to look at that we don &apos;t have to be disabled .
maybe the same concept that we think is just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single disability , more disability .
if we don &apos;t treat people holistically and not all of its forces and opportunities and recognize , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead to another disease .
we <unk> a people who have a value for our society .
so we have to look out beyond the bottom line and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great <unk> .
we shouldn &apos;t be <unk> , or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should return them under the rug , but it &apos;s about recognizing the most compelling opportunity .
i think it may be more about making sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome action , but that we are open , they &apos;re going to give you a hug to put them on the <unk> , to use a <unk> and maybe dance with it .
and maybe we can do it as a kind of natural and natural and useful and useful , and feel that it doesn &apos;t feel so troubled by their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . the birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has written , in my eyes , to something very true in human character .
i would call it this way : not the strongest of their own , and also not the <unk> of its species , but the one that can make changes best .
from conflict , creativity comes .
not just we know from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of humans to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of the human mind , is to transform itself through conflict .
so , again , change and <unk> are the greatest skills of human beings .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested .
it may be exactly the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can make sense of a new meaning that goes out of hard times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest harm that we have to do to believe is that we should be normal .
even honest -- who is normal ?
there is no normal .
it &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and would you really want to know that poor , gray person really , really know if they really had ?
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to bring this paradigm of normal against another one of the options or the strength to even formulate a little more dangerous to formulate a little bit more dangerous to say , we can release the forces of a lot of children , and invite you to engage in their very special and valuable skills to society .
<unk> found that we have always been able to do people from members of our society : being useful to be useful and a contribution .
there is evidence that the neanderthals in front of 60,000 years ago is older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that may be because the <unk> in the state of these people was valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t have these people as broken , and they considered useless ; they were treated as special and precious .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the red , &quot; red zone &quot; in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; if that &apos;s not aimee mullins is . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , you know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you won &apos;t remember yourself .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s made a click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i knew only from my mother &apos;s tales about this day , because i was , of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks later .
the doctor of <unk> medical imaging was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had focused on them , and i just had a few toes in this and a couple toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , he had to make the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk , and never would never be <unk> like other kids , or you never have a independent life , and i &apos;ve never lying <unk> . &quot;
so , really extraordinary , i found that he &apos;d gathered my whole childhood , no matter whether i had won in the second grade in the second , if i was walking down with the <unk> of <unk> , whether i had a scholarship or one of my athletic victories , and he used these clips to teach his students or <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> factor , the x <unk> of the human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how to be the crucial factor of the quality of human life .
and dr. <unk> said on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they didn &apos;t tell something else , and if they just get a little bit of support , if you get kids themselves , kids can do a lot . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with it , two different things are .
and also , i &apos;ve changed the course of time when i had asked me if i had asked my prostheses , whether i had legs for legs from meat and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second <unk> .
i was desperate at the time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and maybe that change could happen as well because i &apos;ve encounter so many people who have opened me doors instead of looking at people who wanted me to cut me up or give me an idea .
you see , it takes a really one of the people who demonstrated you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow it to be able to activate your own , internal forces , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and you &apos;re opening up a door for somebody in a critical moment , then they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they teach them to open up the doors .
the real meaning of <unk> <unk> is roots in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to create something that is in one is the potential for <unk> .
again , what is the potential to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , they were done in the u.k. at the time .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the a student will get a <unk> harder test , getting better teachers , etc .
so , they &apos;ve been given over a <unk> period of students with a &quot; good grade , &quot; they were told they were told that they were very smart , and after those three months they were really smart .
and of course , it was going to be able to hear the heart that vice president said , they were only enough .
and the same way it was , after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- besides the students who were thrown into school .
so the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they were the <unk> , and they &apos;re the students with the note , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> spirit that has broken up , has no hope . he finds nothing more <unk> to him , <unk> , <unk> , and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we can do it , to support the human mind , to continue to hope , itself and other people around you to find beautiful , and then we deploy our forces really positive .
if you have a mind about these qualities , we can actually create a new reality and new design system .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and i was told by my friend jacques <unk> , and the poem is called the god who knows only four words , &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god of the <unk> . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that by a few changes of their genes , they could have a better memory -- more precise , more precise , faster .
or do they want to be stronger , more force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how about to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have been <unk> for more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
some . probably about as many as creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose for a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the idea of a doctor &apos;s view .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get your <unk> off , take your personal <unk> -- i give you the personal <unk> -- and you might give you the permission -- and you might give you a glimpse of kathryn <unk> &apos;s book .
but if you accept biological evolution , remember this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it possible for others , or does it happen to us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have put a bush in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> of these branches have been able to succeed in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; they have survived ; they have survived .
the human part of this <unk> , far by the end , is of course that we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestry in modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different lives of hominids .
some came and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually most of the most fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite equal to our cells .
is it clear that we can take advantage of it , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can be able to produce the protein of the human system , which is used to treat the <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically <unk> of what comes out of the pancreas .
and as we talked about bacteria , we realize that each of us in our gut is more bacteria than cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think about , if antonio damasio asks your sense of self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully adaptive environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all nutrients that they could only offer without effort .
it &apos;s a really lighter way of bacteria , with occasional interruptions of unintended , <unk> push to the outcome .
but otherwise they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help the digestion nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we supposed to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s step back into the big bang of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first evidence of living creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first <unk> organisms , maybe as 800 years ago .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , the life on earth is just short , the animal kingdom , as a single stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> .
we were .
this is also a <unk> of this talk , which is that i hope you ate out the ace of it .
now , when i was a <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love in the power of evolution , and i asked , something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue on both of them .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms turned out , things started to change .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is going to <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of the death of the death of our body in evolution in the same moment in the evolution of reproduction .
now i &apos;m going to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death -- it seemed pretty reasonable for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it came doubts to me .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who in las vegas shows his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
and it &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor , as a doctor , as the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory to evolution , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health after a disease .
i wanted to make that we have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about copying the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you , and i &apos;m like , like <unk> rockets , to send the genetic <unk> into the next level of <unk> , to fall into the sea .
i think we would all understand the mood , the woody allen to all understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to convey immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution is not necessarily necessarily the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest ones , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are present , and therefore , the hot steam , if fish were there , if fish were there , there would be a vacuum in a vacuum , yet they &apos;ve managed to make a <unk> environment there .
so , what does that mean when we look back what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we <unk> into the next stage , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to be moving .
we &apos;ve reached a sense of equilibrium .
and the reason for that is that it &apos;s been able to get us in medicine , in fact , a lot of genes that had otherwise had been otherwise <unk> and had been removed from the population .
and second , we as a species have so <unk> our environment , that we have managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and circulate and mixing us so much that they can &apos;t tell us that isolation is necessary for the evolution of evolution to <unk> .
a second possibility is that it will be an evolution of the traditional way , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution slowly grind slowly .
and so far the isolation is , when we &apos;re a distant planet , it will be <unk> and the changes of the environment that evolution could produce natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying thing .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that isn &apos;t simply , of course , but led to us as <unk> in the choices we do .
now how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s start looking at reality that people are going to make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , a choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so , think of , if it &apos;s not only possible , the gender of your child &apos;s gender , but also to make genetic adaptations that will cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or eliminating the decrease of the risk or a mate ?
would you not want to make these changes in their genes ?
when we <unk> , that kind of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year , when it was done in 2004 , they were doing the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , there &apos;s a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ $ 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more long until the reality is that there will be the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
one week ago , the national academy of engineering is the prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , which encourage the natural process that encourage the natural process of evolution to encourage the natural process of evolution in a more efficient way -- which is called direct evolution .
a couple of years ago , the <unk> photographer <unk> <unk> was given to his research for his research in which he took a grown-up <unk> , a <unk> , and through manipulation of only four genes , the cell induced to go back to a virtual stem cell -- a cell potentially potentially to become in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insulin can produce viruses can make viruses , which is not only protection in front of themselves , but also for the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang versus influenza that has been grown into the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a little good thing that tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and <unk> or <unk> <unk> , to give their kids a better chance to give their kids better for a better chance -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want a healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , can also allow us to adopt it , to adopt a lot of <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t have the <unk> of an ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you extend it to scale it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why don &apos;t they have the fast savings that you &apos;re going to allow you to do faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we are at a place that we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed from <unk> evolution to <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires perhaps 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with whom their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , need to be able to deal .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , which is more likely to be more friendly ?
or are we going to be selectively different attributes that we want to have for some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to form a society that is <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
and most of the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in good like evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions are going to be .
thank you .
i want you to imagine you now , a portable robot , which gives you informed skills , or another , that helps you stand up and go up .
so at berkeley , we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing different than something that you put in the morning , and that gives you extra strength and gives you extra strength to keep your velocity and help them keep your balance .
that &apos;s actually the true melting of human beings and machine .
but not only that -- with that , and connecting with the universe and other devices , there &apos;s out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers that are wearing about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request for you to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we were going to take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or the human human race .
soldier : i can carry 200 pounds on <unk> terrain , for many hours .
and his flexible design allows you to go deep and run deep and <unk> and highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and get my strength and perseverance .
we are on the way that we think about this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now , let &apos;s look at the wheelchair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people around the world around the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young individuals with spinal cord spinal cord injury , who , in the <unk> of their lives -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; fate , the only option is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number multiplied .
and so , pretty much the only option -- if it goes to a <unk> , or the other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been around for 500 years since he has to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in mobility .
now , let me introduce you to <unk> that by amanda <unk> , which is 19 years ago , which has the result of the result that they couldn &apos;t run over 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in crutches , the signals to <unk> the signals on our <unk> , which is on their backs .
here &apos;s also <unk> , and the <unk> is on your hips , as well as your <unk> , which are moving forward in this fairly <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and i was in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he <unk> every <unk> hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to learn to learn to learn , to climb , to climb , and to drive with their hands .
but nothing was invented to go back to me until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all the users , but for everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m a boss of the <unk> of a nonprofit , called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get to poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteer fire , the fire .
now , in our city , in which volunteers have been supported to have a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the classroom to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at <unk> , so i had good opportunities to go inside .
but it was still a race against the other <unk> to reach the <unk> and to find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just been in a very serious conversation with <unk> who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she was standing in the <unk> and she was sitting outside a screen outside the <unk> , while her house was burned .
the other voluntary volunteer that arrived just in front of me -- we call him <unk> luther -- in the first time , the first one was asked to go into the house and get asked to save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was lost in <unk> .
there was some a lawyer or a <unk> , which is now for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he was going into a <unk> house to save a living creature , just because it was five seconds .
well , i was the next .
<unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you must go into the house .
you need to go up , go to the fire , and have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i was hoping for , but i went -- the stairs up and up up the hallway to the real &quot; real &quot; <unk> over the &quot; real &quot; <unk> over the <unk> , which was pretty much done at this time .
i know what you think now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i put my prey back down , where i met my <unk> at the front door and met my <unk> dog .
we put our treasures out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> was given a letter of the <unk> , where they went to save her house at the brave effort .
one of all , we &apos;ve been <unk> valued kindness : somebody had taken a pair of shoes .
and both in my profession with robin hood , and in my school district as a volunteer firefighter , i am witness of generosity and kindness at the big scale , but i also see what the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i can see in this room , and i see people who have you already have a <unk> success , or on your way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until you reached your first million .
if you have something , you &apos;re going to give it right now .
put them in a <unk> room in a <unk> park .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the lives of a human , but every day offers us to change one .
so we put on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the human genome .
a place where women lead the <unk> , with sex , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines -- where fun is a serious business .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their <unk> .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our nearest living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
as chimpanzees from large , fear of <unk> guys are going to lead the <unk> of <unk> female .
they really came up with this , because this leads to a <unk> society that has not been observed in a <unk> society .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known as primates .
they &apos;re living in the depths of <unk> , and they &apos;re just very difficult to have access .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dark itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been needed for decades , and almost as many lives needed to war world .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that the destruction of the bonobos are at risk .
<unk> and the decline in the world &apos;s loss , you can &apos;t even fill the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a homosexual laugh that the trees shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we &apos;re familiar with them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , you know , <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos are made from more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
game increased creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity in interactions , diversity on behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human beings , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s called us .
now , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage out of the wild .
first of all , <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this may be the evolutionary origin of &quot; it puts him in the eggs . &quot;
only i think it &apos;s more , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both by bonobos .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that you get to play with new elements -- like the testes -- and promotes the game of both confidence -- and promotes huge fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can adopt a lot of forms that some of those are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think the same way that they play sometimes , and we &apos;re <unk> boundaries of our inner and outside worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact with , and the unexpected wiring that we form is the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> on the insights , the bonobos give us into our past and present .
but it also has a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , which is greater creativity and institutional responsibility .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
so , to be successful in order to adapt to a <unk> world , we have to play .
but will we do the best out of our <unk> ?
game isn &apos;t silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , and people alike are not the lives of teeth and claws alone .
now , just if you don &apos;t have any appropriate thing , play may be a game .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution , and play together , while we &apos;re doing creativity about <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in the middle 1979 , the same day , at the same time , at the same moment , every <unk> baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because , if you think about all the time , you will not listen to me .
imagine it just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you know , in a case that in a case the sperm <unk> is wearing a y <unk> , which is based on x chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm chromosome is <unk> by the x chromosome in <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both light .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m talking to the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- meaning human body , animal bodies -- like <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , in the other than impatients , in a lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i worked with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who are not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of the kinds of things that don &apos;t correspond to the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene makes the <unk> gene , the <unk> that we &apos;ve all got at the top of the world , to testes .
and that &apos;s why the testes is the same testosterone .
but because these individuals are missing the receptors in order to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body develops more of the typical female trajectory .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes mostly until they reached puberty and grow their breasts , but they &apos;re not going to get their period until somebody is going to get it out there .
and they do a few tests , and you find out that instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , testes , and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that the person could actually hold male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies called <unk> .
you &apos;re in the back of our body in the back of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> that are <unk> hormones .
most women , like i -- i think , i think , to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i &apos;ve probably got the typical -- most women as i speak on <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
and the consequence is that somebody like me actually have a brain that was exposed to more <unk> than a woman who was born with testes , and he has a <unk> .
so , gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across the whole range of all the bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i got the call of an 19 billion years ago , who was a boy was born as a boy , who had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived a man , and he had just figured out he had <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an <unk> <unk> .
he &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so strong that they made essentially a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male in his brain became exposed to <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one had something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was <unk> , that the doctors found out that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , gender can occur in many different forms .
the reason why kids do with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s identical , or premature twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- of surgeons who are often adjusted to the norm , isn &apos;t because that &apos;s the physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason why there are many kinds of surgical interventions are because they threaten our social categories .
in fact , our system is based on the idea that there is a certain anatomical characteristic of a certain identity .
so we have the concept that to be a woman is called a female identity , which is to be a black person , is supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this terrible <unk> idea .
and when we &apos;re confronted with a body that &apos;s actually something very different for us , it &apos;s confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , the two people are in a body .
where i &apos;ve been at the last time , the <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender was asked in berlin world in berlin .
and a lot of journalists were calling me with the question , &quot; what are you going to do with the test , which tells us whether or male <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
now , we know now that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is no line for us to pull out of the male and female , or between male and female and female and female and female and <unk> .
so we have such a situation where the further our science gets on , we have to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve given for stable anatomic categories , which made very simple <unk> to create permanent <unk> , to create a lot more <unk> than we thought .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of what it turns out as much more complicated than our <unk> has allowed .
in our essays , we get into all kinds of disciplines .
we push for example that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re going to tell us just by a few different forms of dna ?
as we move forward to science , we &apos;re increasingly going to get increasingly into a <unk> zone where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we have probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
one of the areas that we see that we see this is in our today &apos;s culture , in the world today , the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what point is to be a body to people so that he has another right than this kind of fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have never been struggling with the question when someone was dead .
they have a <unk> person under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you no longer moved , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people to <unk> people and want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we came up with the struggle with the truly difficult question when someone is dead , and this brings us into a really difficult position in which we don &apos;t have so simple categories like earlier .
now you might assume that all of the kind of <unk> don &apos;t get to make me happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really more insecure than we thought , well , are tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i &apos;m first going to have to go first and i have a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so versatile and strong , and so radical , what they were doing , i &apos;m trying to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the <unk> .
so the founding fathers were from my view of the original community activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they were doing was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radically , and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy built on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power to have this political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather , to the son and so on .
the founding fathers are going back this idea and replace them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were creating equal to the same .
they <unk> the field of play , and decided that <unk> , which are common , the similarities , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they did that because they were part of a <unk> system that &apos;s two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science also grew up .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , clear that many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , and meadows things , like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission is based on a very <unk> concept .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they did a concept that was <unk> .
and so they &apos;ve prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women were using the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that anatomical events are more important than the anatomical difference , and they said , &quot; that we should have a uterus and <unk> . &quot;
and women <unk> that successfully .
next came the successful civil rights civil rights movement where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who was doing it , &quot; am i not woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different color that are facing into anatomical events , again , successful .
we &apos;re looking at the same thing with <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as well as we start to look at all of the commonalities , we have to start to ask why we sustain a certain difference .
well , you want to mind , i want to think of certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
so , for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to get your informed consent to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomic people who make sense of me , and that we should be thinking .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , the same day <unk> .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months <unk> , was born on june 1 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to <unk> , so he was born on one march .
just because of maria , maria <unk> was born by the fact that maria <unk> all kinds of months before <unk> -- the right to have sex to have the right to choose to drink the right .
<unk> has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re going to find other differences in what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s male , you can now get moved in what maria don &apos;t need to worry about .
maria whereas , not all states can be the same kind of thing that has the <unk> of <unk> in all states , and it &apos;s actually to get married .
<unk> can be married in every single state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these sustained <unk> categories that are problematic and problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing that in the realm of anatomy , that we have to reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy is grounded on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going on itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture as a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to pull somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , texas , decided that to marry a man , you can &apos;t have a y chromosome , and marry a woman means you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you at the beginning of the <unk> .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of solution . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t tell people about &quot; their skin skin , but after the characteristic of their character , &quot; judge , and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people like this because i have to admit that i know a series of golden <unk> that will probably make benefits as some people i know .
i want to argue , i probably have some bright <unk> know that <unk> are <unk> , more more intelligent and more productive decisions about their sexual relationships than some of the ones i know .
so how do we make the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s a really difficult thing .
and part of me wonder , what if the content was something that would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- using an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is going to be thinking about questions about questions of democracy .
in our efforts for democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as it is in iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men who &apos;s punished with death , because it &apos;s ready to perform a <unk> , in which case he &apos;s going to stay alive .
they don &apos;t exist in this way .
and i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon with which i spoke to a few years ago that had a few <unk> twins had <unk> to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i sat down with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high school surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
and i answered him , &quot; well , don &apos;t think of political asylum than <unk> them ? &quot;
the united states provides incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are , without the state to change the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish up , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the way that democracy could look like democracy or looked like if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something that is a feminist thing for a feminist is a bit radical , and that is , i think there could be different kinds of insights that are <unk> from different kinds of anatomy , when people are using a <unk> .
since years , because i was interested in <unk> , i also interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from studies of science is that women , on average -- not any , but on average -- more , more , complex social relationships and caring for people who are vulnerable to the people who are vulnerable to the group .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation before us .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , i asked me one of my <unk> who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so do it -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what you &apos;re on with feminism female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> stereotypes about gender , so they &apos;re not a female female .
but the more i thought about his question to think more , i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
that &apos;s going to be called , there might be something , on average , to tell women &apos;s brains from male brains , which makes us focus on <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so , where the founding founding fathers were highly reflective to find out how individuals were protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that when we <unk> more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re not only a concept of not only how to protect it , but how we can worry about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go into the future if we were going to have to think of democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think of identity and to think more about relationships .
so that when we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to take a chance to find another <unk> , crazy outfit , to wear , and i &apos;ve also had to take photograph for the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and also my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people , and my dollars serve for normally a good purpose ; i see quite unique ; it makes my personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to like color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers are yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve raised for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with .
i brought seven <unk> underwear , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for a week is everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have bet bet that i could wear everything i might wear , if i came back to palm springs .
and because you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around at ted in her underwear -- that means i found a few things .
and i want to share with you my favorite story for this week .
it sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to leave you with some of the lessons i &apos;m doing , whether you believe it or not , from these <unk> , not to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has taken me 55 to me , and it was the most expensive piece i carried in this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re pulling other happy people .
tuesday : <unk> is totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my lifetime trying to try and be myself and adapt to me at the same time .
just be just who you are .
if they &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to be able to do it , they &apos;ll estimate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me people , i would be dressed up like i play , or i remember her seven-year-old .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think about it , you look at something well , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think it &apos;s not good , you &apos;re probably right now .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize it for you .
if you believe that they &apos;re inside and on the outside , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fits to everything .
and finally , saturday : one , unique , unique style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word .
it was always shown to me , and again , when people were coming up to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously it won &apos;t fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it to anything .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn from myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to give these things to the emotionally , because the corner will always give another crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just waiting for me when i love a little bit in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason i show you this is what i &apos;m showing you in the formula for the past decades .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula one race , they took your budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now today , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like the car in real time , the information from the car , the information from the car , that information from the car , and then process it to the system to make things back in real time .
this would be , in <unk> , called a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities have been , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they become the computer in the free .
and as the computer in the free , they start to respond to the other way , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
when we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
and by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the oil industry -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
and beyond the cities , all of this sense and engines of your daily life is one .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli for moma later in the year , during the summer , <unk> .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to two , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses , it means he took the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little patch of <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? why are you talking ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins for the first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of understanding our environment and power .
so let &apos;s start with it .
now the first project i want to show you is in fact one of the first of our labs .
it was formed in italy four and a half years ago .
and what we did was actually actually use a new kind of network that was used all around the world -- this is a <unk> -- and using anonymous and <unk> information from this network that will be collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was in italy when it was in italy .
some of you will remember that it was in italy when you played in italy , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy won the end .
now , look at what happened on this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
this is the city .
you see the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
in the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
back in the afternoon , people here , and there , the calls that make calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france does a gateway . italy does a gate .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal play .
first example , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy . yeah .
well , in this night , all of the left to celebrate .
they saw the great rash .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the <unk> and meet the prime minister at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
you see the image of the space of space <unk> , where since the rome roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a great party , and you see the rash at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it .
even quick example of feeling : this is not about people , but to do things we use and consume .
now , today , we know everything about where our things come .
this is a map that shows you all the potato chips that a mac is how they came together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so , in this project , we &apos;ve designed some little markers to track the waste as he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have helped us , a little more than a year , in seattle to tag the things that they can see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they &apos;d throw away from .
and then we have the little chips , the small brands , glued on the garbage and put it track .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with that information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is going to happen a lot of <unk> <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day we &apos;re throwing away , the cup that we throw away , it &apos;s still anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we throw away every day .
and if we show that to people , we can drive change behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague on the mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more about this , and the many of the other wonderful things you can do with can tell you about it , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition of using water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that was at mit <unk> was , imagine these tubes , and the valves , <unk> , valves that open up and close .
it &apos;s causing it like a <unk> with <unk> of water .
when they fall down , they can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to make them open , as you can see in this picture .
well , we presented the mayor <unk> .
he really enjoyed him .
and we got the mission to design a building to design the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but when they approach it , it will open up and make it in .
the roof was also covered in water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce that syringes , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will be , like in this case , you know , this days , if you put the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t get the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
this is what the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not going to get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was more fun in that night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to make them go , but a building that had still breaks breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump to get wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people we design things that we design .
but reality is always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
now , here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projection on it .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have a little helicopter that flies through the air , and every one of you with a small <unk> piece of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you &apos;ve seen earlier that you &apos;ve seen earlier that you &apos;ve seen on the other , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently , but infrequently in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of <unk> .
they can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just appear in different ways or sizes , different <unk> .
but then all this could be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can go and go through and move through that you can look at them from many , many directions .
here you can see a real <unk> unit , which is a <unk> v to form a <unk> v .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person &apos;s <unk> .
it could have a impulse , every single impulse that comes from human beings , from people &apos;s movements or something .
i want to show you something about here .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and <unk> in milan -- we took his movements in 3d .
here you see <unk> dancing .
on the left you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all <unk> , they can play with it , and play with color and play games .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a profit for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that , again , that we bring people to do something , to change the environment -- almost like that , as we call it a <unk> model as you move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for a <unk> .
i think it &apos;s the remarkable thing that is happening for the past years , the last decades , that we &apos;ve changed from a digital world to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it accessible by the internet .
now , for the first time , for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed that -- we can change from the digital world to change the <unk> forces of the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we &apos;re using it to design and create a symbol .
this is called something in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask ourselves the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to change .
so the idea is that , in fact , we actually have the people involved in things together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud from <unk> , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is from <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical thing in london , but it &apos;s covered in <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from below , to share the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and more than the connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky , and something that you can go to , like london &apos;s new <unk> .
you can get in .
and some kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the relationship is very important to me .
and my work i &apos;m trying to say that people don &apos;t separate from nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in the antarctica where i saw my first <unk> .
me did me .
my heart goes , i was <unk> , while i was trying to grab what was before me .
the <unk> around me almost almost 60 feet of water , and i was just able to wonder that this was a snowflake in a different snowflake , year .
<unk> <unk> , as calf or <unk> , are born by <unk> .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with clear ways in their environment and their experiences .
some are refuse to give themselves up and clinging to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t withstand more and make it more dramatic in a <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think light are isolated , separate and alone , just as we humans often see us .
but the truth is far away .
while a iceberg melt , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg melt , he does <unk> drinking water that feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to take my photographs of this <unk> as if i was going to make portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and never even exist again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s a <unk> of their <unk> along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> of the ice i &apos;m very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i &apos;ve <unk> in greenland in greenland .
in fact , you &apos;re actually going to witness a frozen iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat moves down to the other hand , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , the iceberg show you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
it can only use his eyes .
i said to him .
i &apos;ve got a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably to be a complex part of what we admire in the world world and watch .
so we decided that tony -- <unk> -- and support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , that &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking -- cannot communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about the higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &apos; butterfly and <unk> ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- how their fingers are walking along .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very <unk> , how can this be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need for just a check , and instead i put a check , i didn &apos;t know the slightest idea of how i was going to <unk> him .
and i <unk> myself in the place and his father , and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : we &apos;ll get it a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to get a way to make it again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still wearing it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked to a conference later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti at the lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw a <unk> on any surface that &apos;s just registered .
so they &apos;re pulling around and make <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the genital organs , then the <unk> , and then the <unk> , and the final people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate my wife with my wife , and they told her of everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should be able to find a way to control a way that <unk> can control a laser . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , and much over and forth of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first of all , we &apos;ve got insurance companies <unk> the doors and actually get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it <unk> , because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an email , and i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do that , and we &apos;re <unk> and all the images on the walls would be <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;re programmed , we went to <unk> in venice , my children were involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap food system that we bought on the <unk> of venice , a little bit of things out of the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they put them on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can put it for free , we can put the code for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room from somebody else , and this is his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these <unk> before the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony for the first time , drew tony for the first time .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking out of his life life system .
we tended to see his bed so he can see outside .
we &apos;ve set a projector on a wall of <unk> in the hospital .
and he took back for the first time , in his family &apos;s family and friends -- and you can only imagine what was a feeling that was in the parking lot .
we also had to deal with the parking lot in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the <unk> .
and at the end , he would send us an email with this : &quot; for the first time in seven years i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel that i was pushed underwater , and finally someone went up and raised my head up with my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our <unk> .
it holds us in the shelf and let &apos;s continue to develop .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes in the same way .
and someone who has such a compelling potential is made so much more .
so we &apos;re looking at how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all sorts of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards was , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , this is honored , as one of the 50 great inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
and the <unk> thing is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that this april , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the inner-city of los angeles will give an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there will be so much of the toughest advocates of the <unk> there -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible to make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- all of them here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had a programmer , but i had just captured it , and i just captured me with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be every one of them , and this is every single day where you have some people who have to do it . if not now , when ? and if not me , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and it &apos;s probably america &apos;s most commonly <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come to a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
i want to tell you today about circles and revelations .
well , an epiphany is usually a thing that you can find it somewhere .
you go to the block , and it was as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s in <unk> , ohio , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one that was beaten every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she &apos;s saved my life by using the toilet in the <unk> .
they actually did it .
she did for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and he proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it to be a lot of work on <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , wife post that said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
can you ask to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found in the meantime .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to get hurry . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we were crying , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we took them around them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be .
it was something we did .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults to know me , she transformed himself into a box of ashes and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , and it had become a circle -- and the revelation of which i talked about was .
the revelation of the revelation is the death of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned today .
he needs the same thing -- he needs , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you go up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane of smoke .
imagine a power engine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them in the same way , and they said , &quot; no problem , we may have caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had a <unk> machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine off the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns off the engines .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> for hit . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more with the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me on this day .
i learned that in a moment , it &apos;s all different .
we have these <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach and didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the things i wanted to do .
and as i was thinking about it later , i noticed a phrase that says , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because when that wine is , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move more in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we <unk> george washington , pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really adore .
i had a good life .
and in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i asked to be better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i gave my ego to my humanity .
and i <unk> the time that i &apos;ve wasted for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after i was thinking about this , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i haven &apos;t got to <unk> me two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned about -- and while the inner clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ...
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please go into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to be able to do in 20 parts of the way you know it from documentaries .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , not terrifying .
almost like we would prepare for our lives for us .
but it was really sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and the sadness <unk> really in one thought , which is that i just wish me one thing .
i just wish i could grow up my kids up .
about a month after that , i visited my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
yet , not .
and i <unk> , i &apos;ll cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything has a sense for me .
i realized at the time that i connected the dots , that it &apos;s just a great father in life .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i became the wonder in britain that day not die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future and come back and live different .
my call to all of you who fly today is : imagine that the same thing happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine how you change ? and how would you change ?
what would they do that they delayed because they think they would be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are they the best parents they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind this <unk> is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important piece of post in the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we can do the systems , the systems that control and the valves , then we can actually create a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , there &apos;s an effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> device that &apos;s used by a <unk> , and then we are in the business .
and this is the planning project behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are going to pass into the gray black box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s a piece of light , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started exploring our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the purpose of the purpose and purpose .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most profitable part , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed to be <unk> , with these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with <unk> infected , and studying this construct .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> acts like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> on it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to see that this is a <unk> attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box around the gray box , when one particular configuration was discovered , even if this particular program , which is trying to infect it on this goal .
and if not , nothing is doing nothing .
so , that really became my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power power , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> code and found that in two digital warheads , in two digital warheads -- a smaller and greater .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , of people who obviously have <unk> information to all of the information .
they knew all the bits and <unk> that they had to attack .
they &apos;re probably known to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking here -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we &apos;re able to be smart in this code .
so what we were looking for first was <unk> <unk> , because we know what the difference is .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring that to the real world -- with potential targets in real world .
so we needed to have theories about these goals we could prove or disprove .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act in an <unk> goal , and very likely it is in iran because most of the infections were reported .
now in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
and basically , it boils down to the <unk> nuclear power nuclear power and on the <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts on <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and i gave them to their knowledge , to compare their know-how to what we found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor is this moving part in the centrifuge , that black object you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to be able to break the rotor and even to explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , slowly and creepy -- obviously , trying to have a <unk> despair , so that they would not be able to get it quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse by looking at the same data and <unk> .
so , for example , the number one is <unk> out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to use scientific literature , which is how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they are structured in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it made together .
and it got better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s an almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us a lot of confidence that we looked at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like this .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
and we just ran into a <unk> , and we had to <unk> ourselves .
anyway , what we found is that both digital warheads have really come up to the one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slow it down , and the big <unk> starts with <unk> interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in the big , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be hit by <unk> .
this is something really cool stuff we discovered -- made me out of socks .
the gray box is the gray box , and on top of it you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is to do is change the <unk> values of sensors -- so for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it provides <unk> code that &apos;s still on the attack , with the wrong bottom data .
and in fact , this false seed data is already recorded .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is fed with <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just that <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> digital production .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond quickly enough .
so in a power plant , for example , when the big <unk> will be too fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so this is where we need digital <unk> .
and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the <unk> , it will notice it .
that &apos;s frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so for example , he would work exactly so good -- in a power plant or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to be -- as the predator -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> pair of stick as we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and when you do that , you &apos;ll get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask .
now unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the environments .
we have to put the consequences , and we &apos;re going to be preparing better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there was a lot of it reported that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that too ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
and i think that &apos;s the <unk> involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- luckily , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for letting us have a <unk> . thank you ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years trying to put myself in situations which usually are very difficult , and they &apos;re kind of dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in refugee camps -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days of this , nothing than this to food -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to <unk> situations that seem to be exposed to <unk> situations , and all of that to try and study social systems so that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way of understanding the audience and accessible .
so when i knew i would come here to look at the world from <unk> and <unk> , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
some of you may have heard about that , i &apos;ve been putting an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
and i sent a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people a chance to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk in 2011 .
really , some of some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , got a unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will have been letting the <unk> on the talk at the time , or not many clues to the talk at the time .
so what you got was this : your name here presents : my tedtalk , which you have no idea about what the subject is going to be , and then the <unk> of all the ears could be able to be stupid .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
so if you asked me this one year ago , i would not have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
and as i said , i went out in some pretty terrible situations over the course of the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could do anything to do on anything as hard and as hard as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the movie will be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything from up to bottom up to the end , from the beginning to the end , completely related to brands -- from the <unk> you &apos;ll see in the movie , this is the brand <unk> <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to the film with the movie -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to note .
it was &quot; in eternity for always . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have your brand x than <unk> , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every category in the movie .
and we may sell a shoe and he &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that you ever have is , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a awareness of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are a part of life , actually , to get them to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing on the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to be able to look at that , and i would do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use a view of view , because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how this is going to be developing ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth a lot of time to address some of the known brands .
who knows , if the movie comes out , we &apos;ll see maybe a <unk> <unk> .
what do you believe in the answer ?
the answer is highly likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
so ... does not mean that .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at people you have to do it with ...
there are some places we can turn on .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to take a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant in reality , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with her movie . &quot;
and just the way all these companies disappeared after the other .
no one wanted to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , as many people as possible .
in particular , in the world today , this interface of new and ancient media and the most dramatic media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting <unk> that the crowds brings this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re using transparency , this -- this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i like your kind , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- devoid of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , immediately ; characterized by <unk> and access to information , especially in terms of <unk> and access to information .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot of time on transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it &apos;s going to be implemented , it changes something .
but why ? well , transparency is fear of fear -- like this strange bear , the still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is still risky ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell that story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid and my father caught me lying -- and he sits and look at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions , there &apos;s three versions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s one company , one company , one of us , to help us -- and that &apos;s because i have heard john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i realized i needed to do it with my team and go right with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i &apos;ve got friends who make big , gigantic <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends who do little <unk> as i do .
and my friends who make big , enormous <unk> , saying that the reason your movies are so successful at the same time that they have .
and then my friends , you know , do little <unk> , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how do we see ban in the movie ?
whenever i do the path , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i get somebody <unk> , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should get a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
you either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we will be both for men both for men and women , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can answer all of their questions and give you an unprecedented version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller films , we are as a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , making these things -- you know , people are reminded of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what would you describe to you in the words ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you &apos;re supposed to describe something that &apos;s going to be doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes you something positive , unlike &quot; fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
these things have an impact effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , who are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like to really love clothes .
&apos; 80s <unk> meets <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; glamorous glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and stuff like this .
but normally i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes <unk> .
man 2 : the brand that i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
and two : part hippie , partly yogi , partly -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> across the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i were <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s happened was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could invade my head , someone who really could help me understand what they call the <unk> .
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover this <unk> .
if they could do it , they could help me .
they brought her pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who make my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , friends , the friends , the way you live his life , work and so .
all of these things come from and start from a place and come from my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what connection is to the thoughts and feelings about you ?
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queer . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what does it bring us ?
what is the <unk> ? where are the <unk> ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them that aren &apos;t them .
so what else are they going through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid of what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . . well , good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> is two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand <unk> brand .
they are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- things that they &apos;re not safe to be safe , they &apos;re being scared of being scared , these elements , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands are doing so ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii a wii , mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> brands and <unk> tags , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if you ask you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that brings blood into <unk> ?
or are they more <unk> ?
are you something that a little calm , more calm , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile -- profane and agile , <unk> , magic and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
they are reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , safe , sacred and way the dalai lama or <unk> ?
and in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and up and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 times the ones that were willing to dispense with these control that wanted to do with somebody as meaningful and playful as i , and we finally tell us to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have to support -- stories that don &apos;t usually support .
it &apos;s <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story of the story that you &apos;re used today to use the <unk> of the brain , to use both of advertising as well as a movies .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> was being banned .
in the entire city for five years , there &apos;s no posters , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school districts where companies were moving their way into impoverished schools in america .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects i got to the most feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i &apos;m directly interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what these tags have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies might not really have their interest in meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will think is that people challenges the world .
and what was it for you ? what is it successful ?
well , because of the movie of the <unk> film festival , we can see this .
there was the debut of january in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- 900 million <unk> of this film .
it &apos;s actually just a period of two / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film didn &apos;t have to leave you .
there isn &apos;t even online . no <unk> .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost any <unk> we were talking about , they told their customers to let their customers do it .
something that i firmly believe is that when you take your chance , risks make risks that they &apos;re in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that when you train their employees to avoid hazards , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks and take risks .
we need to encourage people to be afraid to have no fear of options that they may be <unk> .
after all , we should welcome the fear of fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome fear . they &apos;ll welcome the risk .
a large spoon full of spoon , so we &apos;re welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of honesty .
and it said , honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; she was welcome transparency by my good friends of <unk> , who <unk> $ <unk> for the <unk> for ebay .
big data will be turned into huge opportunities for organizations around the world .
<unk> : call transparency transparency .
thank you .
now , morgan , in name of transparency : what &apos;s happened now with the $ $ $ $ $ $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , presented to the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in height of $ <unk> to fund my <unk> for the next year .
my name is <unk> .
i made something else in google 18 months ago , and i &apos;m going to <unk> something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is today , i gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access to access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had a lot of museums , and that artwork had no access to .
and then when i went to go and visit this museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- to make art more accessible -- with technology .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
you just go to <unk> .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and passion .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and jumping on a click .
in there they are , they want to go to the end of the gang .
just on . a lot of fun .
through it .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so now i &apos;m one of my <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all metadata .
those of you who really are interested in art , can click here -- but i click it away .
this is one of the images we put on with the so-called <unk> .
for example , this picture , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can do very easily in and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; it &apos;s unaffordable .
but then they really want to go down .
and so i started playing on playing , and i noticed that there is something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went up close , and i noticed , slowly , these kids were taking something .
i was doing a little bit , talking with some known at the met at the met , and actually , that &apos;s a game called <unk> , where a goose is beaten on a stick .
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to go really close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you a sense of , i think , you know what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but it &apos;s in a second .
let &apos;s jump to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what happens when you don &apos;t want to see , van gogh that masterpiece got created ?
you go inside . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in to one of my favorite parts of this image until i really am at cracks .
this is <unk> , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
every one of them , everybody -- just like rich or poor if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go online and create their own museum , and you can build out of all these pictures you can put your own .
very simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- they can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
they can send everything to <unk> , send their friends , and start with a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing that all of the wonderful things are not coming from here .
i think they &apos;re not even from the museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just the digital medium of art , and it &apos;s <unk> online .
and the biggest question i asked myself , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s to have the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a map of your brain . your brain can be divided in two .
this is the left half , which is the logical side page , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could represent their brain .
for example , this would be the completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on that scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of those extreme , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high school force that is at the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
they can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see as one of the individuals , together with most of the experimental <unk> that need a good share of logic to add up the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of the experiments to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing it with things .
so we go out and play it and look like it is , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can be only one place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve been born .
and i remember looking at a child playing on a <unk> .
he was still a toddler , not very good at it , and he was constantly falling .
but i &apos;ll bet that it was playing a very valuable lesson with the <unk> with a very valuable lesson , which is that the big things don &apos;t just get you over , and they stay in a place .
and that &apos;s a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a horrible model for a <unk> because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little odd particles .
and when they play with their particles , they put all kinds of weird things -- how they fly straight through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they did all of these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe a little tiny particle .
but it didn &apos;t need them to describe them around the big everyday objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play with particles as often .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side , it didn &apos;t like it .
because if all of all things are made up of particles , all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s not supposed to be like that .
so , i would feel really better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i did a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
this is what i zoom in here . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a springboard and it stands across the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of <unk> pool of hole and getting the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean if i &apos;m on the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people rise up and i hear all these things , because i don &apos;t want it to hurt it , or frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just like that .
it &apos;s not only human beings , it &apos;s not only human beings , but also the light that seems to them and the wind and the wind on them over and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal turned out to be <unk> , we had to get out of the <unk> .
and we did that .
we turned the light off , put it into a vacuum , and <unk> all the air out and <unk> it up to almost right now , just on the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behave like that .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
rather than that , it &apos;s just quiet there , it &apos;s <unk> . the way it was <unk> , it &apos;s kind of like this -- like <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and in which we gave him a little push , we could reach it to the same time to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate -- something only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and doesn &apos;t vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms are still there , and they &apos;re going to move at the same time moving the same atoms and down .
just too strong <unk> , you agree .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which is at the same time that the whole piece of metal at two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that was a value for all this year in the clean room , because , you know , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece of metal is about just as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom at the same time can be two different places , this piece of metal in two different places , why don &apos;t they be ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel like ?
how would you deal with it that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and <unk> the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact only <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s more than that , there &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things you are , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and a strange quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when the families think about where they &apos;re going to live and work , they have given them to have the opportunity to choose between at least a hand full of different cities that are all in a new inhabitants .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries , which is not even a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth so much more than it costs them .
so we could actually <unk> the world very easily with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this sounds absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never been thinking about new cities .
so , they &apos;re just going to trade in the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine , half of the people who want to live in homes , do this already ; the other half of them don &apos;t .
you could try to extend the capacity to extend existing apartments .
but you know what you were going to be involved in , in these homes and their environment , are law to avoid complaints and push from <unk> .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get out of all this major <unk> .
but you could go to a completely new place to build a whole new block of block , provided the laws there would support such a building and not <unk> it .
so i proposed that governments can create new areas that provide enough space for a city , and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
and then , later , i found out that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of reform in honduras .
and they knew that every year about this country , roughly the country left their country to <unk> in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said to <unk> , &quot; what happens when we put it on a <unk> area of our country , what if we just put them in a <unk> area of our country , what if we just put them a message of the american embassy , a canadian <unk> , and when people are going to go to work under the canadian rules or
in the summer of 2009 , funded under a severe <unk> .
in the next presidential elections , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , the program both innovations , as well as <unk> .
he flew <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , test and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city to reduce elements .
the first thing is , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be able to <unk> existing systems .
we &apos;re paying attention to new technologies , but for progress , it requires technology and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws that we help us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and he showed him <unk> .
they were calling me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in the <unk> of a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than it is .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , and think that a space in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per foot .
but there was a pretty abstract discussion on a place when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form is that a <unk> city is a place , which is a <unk> city , which is a <unk> , which defines the laws that are there , and people will decide either under those rules or not .
so i asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we need to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is going to get our country .
i was asked to hold <unk> , and i was asked to keep a lecture on the fourth and fifth of january .
so i have given another one with facts , which includes a chart like this , trying to prove that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it needs to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and that sketch , the sketch , the sketch that was built in <unk> .
this airport alone has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
polite to all of them .
the faces of the audience were very serious and alert .
the director of congress came on stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have this on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and you &apos;ve played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras for hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be in honduras for their help , they could benefit from their <unk> that they put in the set of law that they would make the laws of this charter , and we would support that everybody is really receiving the charter .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> were going to come here and come up with a way of building the foreign investors to build this city for all parties in honduras that have been suffering and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this is from this place .
it does easily do a thousand square miles .
and shortly afterwards , on the 19th of january , you &apos;ve voted in congress for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> control that is for special <unk> <unk> .
in a country , which has been a negative crisis in congress , was elected for these <unk> to a voice of <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to be part of the constitution , it must be approved by congress twice .
on the 17th , february , it was approved by a voice to a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st of february , february , the delegation of about 30 <unk> traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city city , which is built in south korea , <unk> big than the city of the city .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
already , there were two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it basically , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a <unk> ; and they already consider this area for the second city .
already , there &apos;s already been working on a system that <unk> allowed to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external system .
one country already has been offered to provide his supreme court as a dish , as a dish calling the <unk> system .
and <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even get funding with one .
one thing , as you already know , has been understood , there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
there are lots of businesses who like to put in america especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
around the world there are 700 million people around the world that claim that they want to live permanent in another place .
a million people are leaving latin america and go to the united states .
many of them are dads who are forced to leave their families to get work sometimes , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to eat food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s kids who are trying to find their parents back , in some cases that they haven &apos;t seen since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to build a whole new city in honduras ?
or actually building <unk> from this cities , or <unk> all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice between several cities that are in a new inhabitants ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends in honduras have asked me to say , thank you .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i have recently taken a poll with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are doing a typical americans in a day is <unk> .
recently a study was made with ceos where they were watching the ceos for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics of these ceo , and how much time they were spending decisions about making decisions that are related to those issues .
and they found that the average ceo of the week is busy doing <unk> tasks .
each of these topics was from many , many smaller choices .
50 percent of their choices were hit within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions you needed for an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes are the ones you make in the one hour ?
how good do you think , do you think they &apos;re dealing with decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your hand , because i &apos;m blind , just hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was at stanford university at stanford university , i went to this very much a lot , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time we &apos;ve actually been drinking <unk> .
i loved it to go to this store , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how do you never get something wrong ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 other types of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to the leader of a man , and i asked the ladder , &quot; work on this model , that you &apos;re really doing all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists that came every day and they usually had cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different types of <unk> .
we set up a little <unk> straight at the entrance .
we &apos;ve put six different flavors and <unk> <unk> , and we put it out there , and we put two different flavors of bugs , and we &apos;ve been looking at two things : first , i &apos;m going to get more people standing and try and try and try and try and try and try .
there are more people left when they were 24 , about 60 percent than when they were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what case people bought a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
the people who stayed there when they were 24 , bought only three percent of the glass .
from the people who are stayed when they were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you calculate it , people bought the <unk> of a glass of glass , who they had six to choice when they had 24 to choice .
now , to don &apos;t decide to buy glass <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that it &apos;s also affecting us in very <unk> choices .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it comes against our own interests .
so the theme of the day , financial savings .
so i &apos;m going to show you a study i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were making decisions for retirement of almost a million americans for almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> that were possible to be able to make a <unk> plan that influences the probability of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a connection .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans that people offered anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund has been offered that , in fact , the participation rate has been participation .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , they had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want to do .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund , the <unk> fell on about the <unk> <unk> .
now it turns out , even if you have more possibilities for choice , even then it has some negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the way that the more possibilities they have stood , the more avoiding they were saving it and to choose fund .
the more possibilities you have stood , the more they put their money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme choices are to the choices that anyone recommend from people if our future financial happiness is important .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences to people that are providing more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push forward , even if it goes against their own best .
they get more worse choices -- worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to choose to be less comfortable asking you , even if you make an objective better .
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy this huge shelves of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but in fact , we can &apos;t look at the comparisons and then actually draw something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i &apos;m going to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and tested in different ways -- they can just apply in their business .
first of all , limit .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never been true than today , that less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limit . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose <unk> .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to limit them , and the <unk> possibilities are going to go out , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s going to be a rise , it will be <unk> , and there &apos;s a better improvement .
as a <unk> and gamble , the different head of <unk> and <unk> species are reduced to 15 miles from 26 to 15 to 15 percent , it &apos;s about 10 percent units .
as the golden <unk> corporation , the <unk> of the worst selling <unk> , they &apos;ve experienced the revenues around 87 percent -- a result of the two , the rise of sales and reducing by cost .
you know , the average <unk> today , at least gives them 45,000 products .
a typical walmart gives you a 100,000 products today .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is the <unk> supermarket in the world today , and they only offer them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a group .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that came out of the market recently is how to best the choice was something that david <unk> has been very strong at harvard , it &apos;s a program that will be offered at harvard .
every one of the harvard employees are automatically <unk> in a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice , they &apos;re going to be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limit it .
it &apos;s all important options . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to do it , it can &apos;t be their clients . &quot;
now before we have noon , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience to give a <unk> vacation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read to you that .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read you , and then i ask you to clap with you , if you &apos;re willing to embrace it .
okay . everybody who is ready , <unk> &apos;s offer .
are that all ?
well , let me show you some more of it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
in fact , they &apos;re objective at the first time that the first time more information had more information than the second time , but i would like to guess it &apos;s the second time that you found it in the second time .
because the pictures made it real .
what brings me to the second technology , which helps you deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about the fact that people have to understand the difference between the possibility of understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that would have to feel that the consequences of that and specific felt .
why are people spending average 15 to 30 percent more , if you use a card card or a card card than in cash ?
because it &apos;s not that we feel really money .
and it turns out that when you create it , it feels very specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so , in a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with people in <unk> -- employees who worked for <unk> -- and these people were all in a meeting where they signed their participation for their own <unk> .
and during this meeting , we have the meeting exactly as they were always , we &apos;ve added a little bit more thing .
the small thing that we have to do is we have asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation around 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or get a increase by four percent in the amount that they were willing to pay for the most dramatic .
third technology : <unk> .
we can get better than more categories than more choices .
for example , here &apos;s a study that we did in a <unk> <unk> .
it turns out that there &apos;s <unk> up and down in the northeast area , and down in the northeast area , a number of magazines revealed a number of magazines up to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
when i &apos;m going to show you 600 magazines and <unk> you to 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to give you 400 magazines , and then you think of them in 20 categories , you think that i gave you more choice and give you a better job than i gave you the 400 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left display is <unk> , and the ad on the right is jazz , then you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the on the left is jazz , and the one on the right side is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz , and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly sophisticated <unk> .
the categories have to say <unk> something that provides the choice .
and this is often , if you look at the long list of all this fund .
who do you want to inform you ?
my fourth technology : premise of complexity .
it turns out that , in fact , we can handle more information than we think , we have to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , who gives them a chance to <unk> her car .
you have to make 62 different choices to design their car .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices they provide per choice .
<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
so what i do now is , i change the order of making decisions .
half of the people &apos;s many possibilities , 56 enough to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the clients goes from the low possibilities , four gears to the 56 , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how are they interested .
if you &apos;re constantly using the decision of the decision , that means that you become overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what it is to find out is that the people who go from the many <unk> are always going back to the low <unk> and again .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of changing the information .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the gears choose to pick up nothing about my preferences at the interior , i &apos;m still going to pick it out .
it <unk> me in excitement about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m ready to let me be interested in being interested in .
let me sum up .
i told you about four techniques that have the problem of <unk> <unk> -- just -- they &apos;re going to give you the <unk> alternatives , <unk> -- make it real ; we can get better with more categories , less possibilities , less possibilities .
every one of these techniques i describe to you today is to help you manage to manage -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people they provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re a choice of picky .
and the more we are in selecting picky , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> with youtube . i was looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then then , why that &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars , celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so hard .
but <unk> has allowed us to have all our creative activities , or all our creative activities , in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded to a minute .
it &apos;s only going to be a tiny percentage ever , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he filmed in front of his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been 23 million times seen .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was popular as the first summer of the first time .
actually , <unk> didn &apos;t want to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because it &apos;s because you do that if you have yosemite mountain <unk> .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and that video was actually sent in january in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> &apos;s tweet that the video was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> makes us new and interesting things and show a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> will <unk> on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and i didn &apos;t think that &apos;s the conversation .
rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular clips of the year .
it &apos;s been looking at almost 200 million times .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened to happen on this day ?
well , it was friday . it &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> it , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson j. nelson j. john j. science theater was a first one who made a joke on twitter .
what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> is a point of view of <unk> , and <unk> this process and accelerated the process .
and then this community formed from people who shared these big <unk> , starting to talk about it and playing with it .
now there are 10,000 miles of &quot; <unk> &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single week .
unlike the <unk> entertainment conversation in the 20th century , the participation of the community is going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or do something new from it .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
this is , very simple .
this year , it became almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that has been looked at four million times .
even cats even look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
the important thing is , the creativity that is in terms of <unk> and <unk> .
there was remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the ground that made it from a silly joke that we all can participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just think about something we do with .
who would have anticipate that anything ?
who can have predict &quot; double <unk> , &quot; or rebecca black or <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what <unk> did you write in that kind of <unk> ?
in a world , in which every minute , two days of video can be uploaded , only really unique and unexpected <unk> as i mentioned video .
i &apos;m going to admit , i wasn &apos;t very much interested , as a friend told me to look at this great video , about a guy who was protesting in new york for bicycles .
i got a traffic ticket , because i &apos;m not going to be on the <unk> , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t have a decent properly .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , a casey <unk> was a funny thing and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we &apos;re creative .
and all of this leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access and in the audience .
as i said , one of the currently biggest stars -- justin bieber &apos;s -- made his beginning with youtube .
no one needs to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture .
and these are not the features of the ancient media , and they &apos;re also not going to make the media from today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between three generations , and how the amazing strength of that connectedness has been living in the life of a four-year-old girl , when she was over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , five days , and she was sitting in a little boat in the chinese sea , and had a connectedness in the
the story is not over .
she &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by <unk> and freedom of his home .
hold him at the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he remembers that his life was a single waste .
the words , so long , his friends , <unk> now .
he moved into the silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never would ever forget me .
i had to make sure that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to <unk> us , but we came from .
the next <unk> show , like a boat in the early <unk> <unk> <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- in a <unk> marriage , with two little girls .
they had a task for her to ask : the <unk> of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that you could fail .
after a four year-olds and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat calm down on the lake , as <unk> being disguised .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear they had before pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little <unk> .
if you had a <unk> , my sister , and i , and my grandmother was drinking .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady <unk> of the engine , this <unk> of the wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came up many times , but they <unk> from the <unk> of men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the engine , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the ice cream off the coast of the coast , and the young man , the collapsed , and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first <unk> i had on the platform .
no apple ever tasted this .
after three months in an refugee camp , we ended in melbourne in melbourne .
and the next generation of life is about four women in three generations that are building a new life together .
we went down to <unk> down , and one of the working at the middle of the middle of the <unk> , the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no <unk> .
the odors from the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were shared between people who had one thing in common , they started <unk> .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line of <unk> , six days , double layers .
they somehow managed to find the time to have english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar was given , and i put in more education in education , and i put in math , no matter what we needed to do for it , most of the things that would come from second hand .
two <unk> for the school , each to cover the holes in the other .
it &apos;s a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here , and there &apos;s &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
home where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was one meeting for reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the road . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day and heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job of staying up every night , until their <unk> came to get her <unk> .
she opened up a <unk> , and she was going to be a <unk> and opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , caught between two worlds .
loans and donors were searching .
centers were built up .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , who hired <unk> demands .
in the other part , i was involved in insecure life that wore tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the <unk> .
but many people got help over the years .
and because of that help , i became as young as a young year of <unk> as a young year .
and i was <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le <unk> <unk> <unk> , now tan le , refugee and social activist , which was invited to talk to places that she had never heard of , and in homes , whose existence she had never imagined .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the computer science .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go in the routine and the comfort of the life of an unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , every one of her days , as <unk> as they &apos;ve been in 20 days , telling each other the stories of her day , and <unk> , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
it reminded me that i was so old as she was climbed the boat back at the time .
no , no .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the neglect of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved living at the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated from my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t be able to try to try to address the career of the career .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , <unk> in the image -- not just okay , but something that you must be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead to collapse of the horizons , so easy to mean that you &apos;ve accepted the assumptions of the environment .
now , i went out to know enough of my <unk> to know that , yes , the world is <unk> , but not as you <unk> it .
options that were not allowed to have been explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i &apos;d collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , which was not a <unk> challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
at the end of one tags , i cooked a huge concrete soup we shared .
we were working late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant people , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to move into the united states .
just a trip there .
my gut gut .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i &apos;m talking about this talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in which <unk> the social norm and the local mandarin the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after their birth .
her mother blew them up alone .
when she was 17 , she got her second woman to mandarin , whose mother turned her .
and without support of her man , she was worried about a <unk> by <unk> him in front of court , and she was <unk> in her own case , and a greater <unk> she won .
&quot; nothing &quot; would be <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and i saw them stand on the other side .
i knew she was to say goodbye .
my mother called me a couple of minutes .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around their coffin .
we told her stories , and they were telling her that we were still in their own .
at midnight , at midnight , and he said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t go off . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s by the women .
you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives that might have come to us .
the defeat would have been too easy .
i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
who would ever be one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave every wave of the wave , the <unk> , physically <unk> the engine , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could make sure , i would do it .
also , <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it at all ?
because this is , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
but my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera , at the age of 15 .
i put it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , it was a process in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press a trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about making the right place to be in the right place .
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process is going to start when the catalyst are pushed .
and photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and we still have a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture , but i would always like to make it look like you can have , in a picture .
photos that you have to think about a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea as a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle puzzle , where you can take some different pieces and create a different reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect objects , which we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , we can combine something that &apos;s still <unk> as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a realistic picture look like , i think , are the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to obey the outcome , to achieve a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
but they can combine something special about this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , put together the same <unk> .
and these two pictures meet these two requirements -- from the same altitude shot , and the same height .
and third , it &apos;s about making it possible to make it possible , where the individual images start and end by connecting them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to tell how the photo was actually composed .
so by looking at color , contrast in the edges of the individual images of the individual images , photographic imperfections , like <unk> , <unk> colors and dysfunction , we can look at the boundaries between the different images and let you see a single picture , which is fundamentally hundreds of levels of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of a photos of different places .
and i personally agree that it &apos;s easier to create a place as to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to take trade-offs with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed a few months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the bank comes from another place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i have even <unk> the house on the island of red , to make it look pleasant .
so , to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s going to be coming from me to planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very good planned .
and when you get good recordings , the result can be pretty beautiful , and even quite realistic .
so these are all tools , and the only thing that are limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the original organization was to think of it .
and they &apos;re not very scientific about this , and she does a cup of coffee and tea and asks the patient , families , relatives , &quot; how do we go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this one of the main problems that is one of the main problems that everybody -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . this is a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i get on that .
and yeah , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job for 95 pounds .
it just works : every time i get to the scale , you send my data on google health .
and it &apos;s where they &apos;re also going from my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , not just the moment that i have a lot of support , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know that , i &apos;ve been across 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i get on my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , &quot; for lunch , just a little lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen because it &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used for obesity .
but it could also be used to get people out of their seat , and get them to play together some kind of game to control their health .
next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to be this little bit of <unk> that you &apos;re going to get to an iphone or so forth .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to send it to their doctor and share it with other things , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into the game , and they can &apos;t only take control of the control , captain on their own ship , but also in health care , in the face of health , we can also help in health care with the challenges that we have , and the health services of health care , double demand , and so on .
make the methods that are easy to use , and they start to hug with these patients in the team .
and they can achieve that by <unk> , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
we have all <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where the atm machines are around <unk> .
we know one where all of petrol stations are .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient help ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving <unk> was at that moment .
so what did we do ? we conducted <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website , and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed while it &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find a apps for this .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these trade-offs .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone is going to be able to use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you &apos;re also trying to find your iphone in order to find the nearest <unk> that can save lives .
and by today , we don &apos;t just want to be as <unk> as a product called the product is called <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from others &apos; universities , to help us to behave , like <unk> , to crowdsource the world bank .
and if you &apos;re on vacation , and someone is going to be your own blood , or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all around the world are helping us with <unk> of these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technician , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still at its place .
please help us , and try to improve health , not just to improve the health , but to take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to do that we &apos;re going to force ourselves to environment by ...
... it &apos;s given to <unk> .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s charged .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
no .
this is not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the star in technology and to get a year off and work in a environment that &apos;s pretty much everything you really hate , which you really hate , we have them working in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> of geeks .
we pick some fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps there , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really addiction is somebody who &apos;s <unk> him when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at <unk> when it &apos;s a meter of snow .
how did he look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston with the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of february <unk> .
and they realized that the city never had this fire hydrant .
but one fellow , a man named erik <unk> , he noticed something else , and that was that the residents of the sidewalks are <unk> <unk> , right before those parts .
so he did what everybody was doing good engineers , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> it off to <unk> when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can name it a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that have written fellows last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other <unk> .
it &apos;s spreading fast .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of their citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these things work , but the people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago , it has just launched so that people <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> .
we now know nine cities , planning to use this app .
and it handled common , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
it takes a few years of software in the rule a few years .
we had a team that was working on a project in boston , working on a project in boston , for three people and a half months .
it was about a way that parents can find out which the right public schools are for their children .
we later told that if it was about the normal channels that took it over two years , and it would have cost two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california law that the taxpayer cost two billion dollars so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of the government .
so , an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading into a shot before the front of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think that it should .
and not even like <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that it represents a new generation , which is the problem of governance -- not as the problem of the collective institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need to tackle things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who get up up and write <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they complain about they fix it .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the queue of the <unk> and all the other things that we &apos;re really upset with is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; which we can &apos;t do . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given up the government today .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you &apos;re going to be <unk> because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately takes their power from us -- <unk> yourself , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; as we think about it , how we think that change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about the government to choose people in office .
now after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in local communities .
this is the call call for service and information .
they usually come out of when you &apos;re in your city of <unk> .
if you ever have the chance to have the chance to work in your brain center , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to see that the people , the government , call the government because of many different problems , including a <unk> in your house .
now , scott gets these <unk> .
he &apos;s <unk> into the official database .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house , and see very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . then , for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
it &apos;s not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual actual report -- came in , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . &quot; can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
scott <unk> from human beings .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , there was a neighbor .
and the next point that we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yeah . alive ? <unk> .
turned on the side to the side . went home .
good night , cute <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital of the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped other citizens , but the government was playing a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have connect them with government benefits , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and <unk> alternative services .
if the neighbor of the other , we &apos;re helping our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things we have to think about it is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they believe it was the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is .
how often do we have chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we expect the government to reflect our values and it &apos;s not a lot of change , and it hasn &apos;t changed much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a farther ocean and politics are the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s all this contempt that we own , and we pay for that we &apos;re paying for that we &apos;re going to pay for us to work against us , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to be involved in the engines of government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of environmental citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not being politically active , which is <unk> .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face .
do we really believe that we do what we need to do without improving an institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to make the function of the government in a way that can actually do something that can actually achieve society .
and there &apos;s one generation that grew up on the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things in common , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with their voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we &apos;re all fighting to talk about who are allowed to talk to you .
you can make your mind , on every channel to every time , and they do it .
so , when you &apos;re confronted with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care so much about using their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that are improving the work of the government .
and these applications let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be , like <unk> , a fire hydrant , to <unk> weeds with a garbage flip of the <unk> .
and sure , we would have this fire hydrant <unk> all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories , that we are not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government to pay and receive benefits .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , we &apos;re all going to get a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
normally , my role in understanding the people , to explain how wonderful the new technologies that are on the rise are going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here with friends , i would tell you what i really think about , and to understand what &apos;s really happening with this incredible self .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a short , boring slide .
... if you could show the slide .
this is a slide that i happen to be picked up from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather the <unk> form .
this slide shows data from an analysis of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a quantum area area .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like so many others , which we often find in our field , is a kind of <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a potency of the power in <unk> .
and this is a novelty that we have to use this type of scale on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
so this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back again .
a little bit brighter because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper right here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology ?
the reason for that is when i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , the timeline of a way , and this is an arbitrary amount of technology that i want to represent with a graph , which is then silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would be very <unk> on the <unk> scale , in a flat line .
but if something like this is happening here , it changes the <unk> circumstances .
so , if the <unk> would be as fast as the <unk> progression , then we could get <unk> into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
this has never been before in the history of <unk> , that kind of <unk> growth , which has increased the scale of the scale of all years .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask you now is if you look at these exponential curves , you can &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything has evolved for always and forever as fast .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic <unk> like here , to something completely new , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really , really , that means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself , is what this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very confusing , when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a child in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now , here we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
further than we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future is shrunk to a year since i am in the world .
i think the reason is that we realize there is anything going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know it &apos;s just not going to make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future because it &apos;s all going to be so different that it &apos;s going to be so different from what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
now i want to talk about what could be that transition in which we &apos;re currently in .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have a technology or a computer .
because i think to really understand this , we need to step back and look at the thing on a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the earth &apos;s life of life .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and two billion years of the earth , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals on it .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they <unk> the <unk> .
i think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to show you a <unk> story of which , at this time , little <unk> <unk> of chemicals in terms of chemicals in their chemicals .
some of these <unk> had a special combination of chemicals that allow them to integrate other chemicals from the outside , and thus grow .
all the things were , began to slice .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
but , however , this isn &apos;t about alive today , because every single one of them was a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they have distributed chemicals in them in the disparate quantities .
so each one was a bit different .
in fact , the <unk> , which was one for the growth of the growth of the growth and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so , these tended to survive longer , and they multiplied in <unk> extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interestingly , it will be more interesting if that <unk> was learning a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , they &apos;ve learned the ability to understand information <unk> .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , which is in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found a way in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to give them what they were told to be recorded and copied this information and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of thing is to store information about 2.5 billion years in which it came out of the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , which is exactly the same code , and the same code .
and that is , every living thing is using the same letters and the same code .
we are , as far as we are , just to see , in this code , in this code .
and i &apos;ve got a 100 percent of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from <unk> .
in it , what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is from normal letters , which we use to use -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i put it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants to take a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even everyone in this room , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been a <unk> , i would have written them on a virus and released in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step where things were completely different , and that was to communicate these cells and exchange information , so that communities were born of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
that &apos;s why for example , it grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how they can stay from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to each other , because the bacteria communicate .
this communication allowed to allow the reasons of communities , which in some sense were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survive , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more often and by evolution .
now , the <unk> is where these communities are so close to these communities that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community into a <unk> .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities from many of the <unk> <unk> , which are acting together as a single organism .
in fact , we are also such a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that don &apos;t have any more on their own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started themselves , so that the level of which evolution took place , no longer the single cell , but the whole <unk> that we call organism .
the next step is now within these communities .
the <unk> began to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that made nothing other different than process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that we &apos;ve built up these <unk> .
they started educating specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and making information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that time an individual -- learning happened in the time period of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary amount of time .
so an organism could learn for example , not to eat a particular fruit , because she liked a little bit and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could actually happen within a single organism , whereas there were hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information has had to be learned from the individuals that were dying because of these fruit , because these weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous system has this particular <unk> system using this particular <unk> , because evolution could be within an individual form .
it could happen within a time of time .
so what happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate a way to communicate .
as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and basically , <unk> sounds of me , in hope to create a sort of <unk> idea in your head that have some resemblance to my mind .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sounds , a sequence of sound , and producing something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we have humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same steps , which has gone through the fossil abstraction -- the abstraction of our methods of how we hold data .
for example , the invention of the language was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle that information .
and it all connects us to something that is much bigger , and also capable of making itself faster than we were so far .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> little <unk> where he has shown a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> again .
the first steps of the story , which i told you , is a billion years per billion years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the extra steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem very few decades .
the process is <unk> by itself , so i think <unk> is the word for it -- if something <unk> its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feeds from itself .
i live living in the building of the building of computers , and i know that i can use the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not using the recently made of progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design that in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what &apos;s also doing the designers from thinking <unk> , is , we think of a certain kind of view , and that &apos;s what the machine , and the machine makes something that our skills are far beyond , better and faster than we could ever make it .
and it &apos;s part of the methods that we don &apos;t even understand until now .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
and this is what we put in the machine in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s being developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , please chosen a hundred million randomly sequences of instructions .
now , i &apos;m going to run all of these chosen instructions , leading all the programs , and finally pick those programs , and eventually pick the people who are the next ones . &quot;
so in other words , i define first what i want .
let me just say , i want numbers of numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for this .
so , find programs that can be most likely to be able to use numbers .
of course , the chance in random chosen instructions is very small , that they kind of kind of sort of kind of kind of <unk> numbers , so they won &apos;t actually make the instructions .
but one of them may be two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the number 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve got to the next one .
store this , <unk> the rest .
now <unk> <unk> , which are the numbers best in unison .
and that is , with a method of <unk> , analogous to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are extending the features of the data of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came out through combinations of programs that have come closer to the guidelines that are others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them .
demonstrate some mutations .
and try to do it again with another generation .
all of these generations need few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution for millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated than a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are as much more efficient than any program i can ever write from hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
these are abstruse doctrines and weird programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
and i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he <unk> a card , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made out of <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make your flight safer , &apos; don &apos;t you make it safe ? &quot;
we know it &apos;s not optimal , if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start to leave on computer , for a process , which is different from the classical engineering engineering process .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of that .
so <unk> <unk> is the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we are able to do these processes even faster .
so it arises .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so puzzling .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we put up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analogous to the way that <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t see what the hell we &apos;re doing here are .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think it &apos;s something that happens .
i think it &apos;s very fundamental to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
well , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;ll hear here now before i &apos;m going to <unk> .
my story begins in rajasthan , in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was in the desert sky with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the age of the ancient indian <unk> mahabharata .
if we wanted to travel at the time , we went to a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
at the time , when the big indian <unk> slide had <unk> thirst , he took a bow , shot into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came up with the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that was really sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it was scared to me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset back without camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not killing technology .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and in my imagination .
it came like this as well as we were holding our fancy watches and dreamed of it down .
they would be inspired by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it magic to make magic .
at 16 , i started figuring out books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
the storytelling is getting more and more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m going to just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and it becomes a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps -- which is really <unk> to me .
the child in me is really excited about such an opportunity .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean the magician and dragons , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
and i found fireflies in a glass , i found always very exciting .
this is how you have to pour the ipad out here and the fireflies .
and these light through the rest of the book .
another idea that i was fascinated as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a <unk> .
and therefore , here &apos;s every book , and every world , a little bit of <unk> , i &apos;m putting here with the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always had maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and lights and serves for guidance in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be other digits of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is <unk> , but also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> chambers , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history of children .
a story related to new issues , like the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , one big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without reaching .
but now , using mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads and the camera of the ipads .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and to tag a photograph .
in one other chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually did .
there &apos;s a variety of ways to connect the world and technology to each other .
and in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads , and by augmented reality , an animation of resemblance to a plant in front of the house .
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , it would blow the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of the technology is closer to the technology and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we get closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons , or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there are very much hopelessness .
to be here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating that is , i gave a lot of power .
and in the short time here , i got a clear : ted has an identity .
you can tell you things that have influence around the world .
and sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and force that it would not have otherwise .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but they &apos;re particularly meaningful the words of a dedicated teacher .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this as a lawyer in my work .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was a big in a family , a traditional <unk> household that was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had an effect .
she had the last word in any <unk> .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as slaves .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped their world very much .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and i went to me .
and they said , so i could barely breathe , and then they made me go .
one or two hours later , when i encountered her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; no , &quot; she <unk> me again . when i said , &quot; yes , she would let me quiet .
she was something that made it to be close to it .
the only problem is that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember eight or nine , i have to be like eight or nine , that i woke up one in the morning and all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the helicopter , and my grandmother was staring at me .
first i thought that was a game .
and i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood up and came over to me , and she took me over the hand and said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember that as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
and she took me out , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , &quot; grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to watch you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , my mom would always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to do with promise you will always take care of you . &quot;
i call my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; the next thing i &apos;m going to do is you will always do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country in the old , rural , rural , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought my sister with a grabbed of beer with my sister and i went and went to the forest .
we &apos;re only <unk> around there .
and he took a drink of beer and offering my sister &apos;s sister , and she took me on , and then offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . do you . i don &apos;t want beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do you know . today , you &apos;re going to do whatever we do .
i had whatever , your sister had a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . do you . you only do . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , <unk> . &quot;
and then he looked up in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going crazy for the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all of her to be special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is probably going to transmit public public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m sure i &apos;m never drinking a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i &apos;m saying that identity is power .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they don &apos;t think of .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could .
of course , my grandmother would tell her their grandmother , they were something special .
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the subjects that we have to care about .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , they were 300,000 people in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest <unk> in the world .
seven million people are discharged on the left or with <unk> <unk> .
in my view , our world has fundamentally changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population are despair and despair , because of these changes .
one of the three male black between 18 and 30 is in custody , in prison , in prison , left with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles , over in the los angeles , baltimore -- there are 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men in prison either in prison , in prison , discharged from <unk> or <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by just a kind of kind of kind of thing that we have to do with <unk> , and it &apos;s devastated by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty of it as poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affect the result .
however , we seem to be quite satisfied with it .
a politics of fear and anger and anger have convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some <unk> developments .
my home state of alabama is permanent <unk> when they &apos;re offered to be convicted .
here , and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population are going to be lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , we &apos;re <unk> the ratio of the civic forest , as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i got children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states states of america is the only country in the world that <unk> children in prison in prison .
in this country , for children , there are <unk> <unk> in this country without a lot of history .
we &apos;ve already got a lot of stuff .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe that because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a man deserve to die for a <unk> crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : anybody for a crime deserves the death , but , we deserve it to kill it ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve executed before , one that we were <unk> for innocent , who was discharged from death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let somebody fly with an airplane when for nine planes , taking a crash crash .
but somehow , we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i mentioned my students african-american history , i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time at the end of the world war , until the beginning of the second world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the african-american in this country , there was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
so these older people are going to come to me and say , &quot; mr , <unk> , you talk , you &apos;re talking . you tell people to stop saying , for the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of motivated motivated and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions have in the historical context .
we constantly bumping together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we are not willing to approach the process of the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not to overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , it was the willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept a couple of talks in germany in germany .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists was after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you talk about . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death penalty .
and of course , it can never be in germany . &quot;
it was completely silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever have to tell us about systematic people .
it would be <unk> of us , and in voting with people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world in which the german state had <unk> people , especially if there were many jews , many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the old <unk> , we put people down -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted of death , 11 times higher when the victim is white . 22 times higher when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher when it &apos;s black .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we &apos;re not concerned with these difficult topics , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , the realities of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s important to me to combine both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to pass in a complex world .
and for me , for me , it means making time to think and talk about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , who will never be at ted .
but think of a way that is integrated in our own life .
we all need to believe in the same thing that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re doing it as well as we are , so we appreciate the intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s these <unk> , which i think is driving us not just open to all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said .
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe , we wanted to do anything , but what we needed most was hope , an intellectual guidance , the willingness to be in <unk> places , sometimes to be in <unk> .
these mental orientation is the core of what i think also has to be engaged in .
there &apos;s no line about technology and design that allows us to be fully human , as long as we don &apos;t also have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges much more from us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she will deeply touch them .
so as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and again , woman parks , again , came back to <unk> , where they <unk> two of their oldest friends , these older women , <unk> <unk> that organized the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a <unk> , whose husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were taking up and talked about it .
and down to me , i went and said , &quot; <unk> , woman parks coming into the city . we want to talk .
do you want <unk> and listening ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just stopped .
it was so inspiring to be so inspiring .
one day i sat there and i listened to these women , and after a few hours , women turned to me to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the arts is right .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to make injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight the bias and discrimination in <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without understanding children .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want to eliminate progress . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and she said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
she said , &quot; it will make you very , very tired . &quot;
and then he <unk> himself to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to address these challenges : these problems , that suffering .
because the humanity is ultimately depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
when someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody does something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone , not just a killers .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , i believe , in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty , is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s not .
i think in many places , i think , is the opposite of poverty justice .
and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulated , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not to be measured in our intellect and minds .
eventually , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but it &apos;s about how it deals with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to grasp the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i push too much .
i &apos;m going to tired , like all of us .
sometimes , these ideas are ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i got these kids who were convicted too hard punishment .
i go to the <unk> and i go to a client that might be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s supposed to be an adult before .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how does a judge can turn somebody into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge is looking at it as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and my god , if a judge can transform us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should do what would wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it really , i started working on one .
i had a <unk> , poor , black boy as clients .
and i started to address this . the headline was , &quot; bill , my arms , <unk> black clients like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in my bill , i explained that the <unk> of the <unk> and the police are as well as <unk> .
there was a crazy line on this country that in this country , there was nothing more important in this country that there &apos;s no failures .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i dreamed of these crazy bill or dreamed of it .
and i had not only written it to my horror , but i was sent to court .
a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to make you in the dish and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard .
finally , i went out of my car and went the stairs to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer , &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of it . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it was a little bit deeply deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked up .
the judge was seeing me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , they put these crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started arguing .
more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors and down .
he keeps seeing the window through the window , and he could hear all the <unk> .
he went up and down .
finally , this older man came up with a very <unk> guy with a very <unk> <unk> , and i sat right behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judges quit .
and during the break , a <unk> in which it was upset , the janitors was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran across to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give you the goal . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to the ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum <unk> the universe is far <unk> , but that it &apos;s justice .
that we are not fully designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our entire survival is connected to each one .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who are also saying that , just say , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up the goal .
you &apos;ve seen that community in this audience , and that community has seen an obvious desire and to help them .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a spring in this spring , where it comes to , in fact , a kind of effort , something from the <unk> <unk> , which is in the politics of the punishment .
here , in california , in california , you will get a billion dollars for the next five years for a death penalty rate for a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all of them don &apos;t end with a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> are not coming in court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this <unk> is suggesting that the money is going to invest in more <unk> and safety .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the u.s. economy has declined immense .
and that &apos;s a fact that a lot of a relationship has been asked by increased <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , that number didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the major people in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
that &apos;s why dramatic numbers are coming in prison .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; that people are going to bring people to the grid for the <unk> , for the theft of theft good , rather than they force them to force the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become a <unk> , not less .
and i believe that our current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they really brought a string string .
they are an inspirational personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is an increased <unk> <unk> .
famine : famine in somalia . every three : o.c. spray 3 : o.c. spray .
4 : malignant <unk> , five : dangerous <unk> .
lg : social decline . social decline .
<unk> : <unk> . speaker 9 : <unk> .
different speakers : mass destruction . weapons .
recession . a standstill . <unk> . egypt .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds are given attention to these subjects .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second every second , our senses start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because it &apos;s not more important to us than our survival is the first stop for all of the information that is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is the amygdala , our <unk> .
and in addition and <unk> all the information to search for any <unk> of risk in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it goes down , &quot; the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , which is seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a wonder that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe this is the reality .
maybe the enormous progress we &apos;ve done in the last century , which we &apos;ve done in the last century , is so strong that it &apos;s possible for us in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we already have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at solving problems in a very long term , but then they eventually came to overcome them .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so that we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
it has a tenth of decrease in child mortality .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and cost costs are reduced by a few more .
so , steve pinker shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is up by 25 percent in 80 years from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations on all the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
remember , a great proportion of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , mobile phones , <unk> , air air and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have been able to dream like this .
the basis for a lot of these technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be a huge leaps at the bottom of moore &apos;s law is a huge leaps in the end of moore &apos;s law .
so the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it &apos;s -- in good like bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowing down to none of our big problems .
and then , despite your logarithmic <unk> on the left it goes up .
so the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everybody .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; <unk> , &quot; you call sensors and networks , robots , 3d printer , which allow the personal production to democratize the planet on our planet , synthetic biology , is synthetic biology , synthetic biology .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer at risk ?
it was big .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love those , &quot; watson &apos;s human opponent . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of the language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of each owner would be available to each owner .
and four years ago ray kurzweil and i was at ted a new university , called singularity university .
we bring our students with all these technologies with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services , that can affect the lives of billions of people in a decade .
think about that , that a group of students can influence life from billions of people .
30 years ago , it would have been ridiculous .
today , we can refer to dozens of companies who have done exactly this .
if i think abundance , create abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating goods , creating goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
the king of <unk> had <unk> .
aluminum was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome is made of aluminum made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> needs , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> is developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think of <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet with <unk> more energy than we use a year .
16 percent of energy <unk> all <unk> minutes on the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve got it for the first time to reduce the cost for solar power in india -- <unk> rupees , compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar is going to be 50 percent last year .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that to the end of the decade in the sunny areas of the united states in the sunny areas of the united states , is going to cost six cents at national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we will also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember when carl sagan , in 1990 , when carl sagan , when it was on saturn <unk> to the earth ?
he took a famous picture . what was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a life of life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we are fighting 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 years or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation with dean <unk> with dean <unk> , one of the innovators i do it , i want to share with you something -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a <unk> .
it can generate a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day -- whether saline , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
and the chairman of coca-cola has just <unk> to launch a big deal with a hundred units in the developing world .
and when everything is going well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
oh my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent <unk> of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just remember that a <unk> cell with a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> than president reagan about 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication and communication has ever been able to predict .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of medical medical diagnostics -- are now going to be <unk> and cheaper in their cell phone .
and the best part is what &apos;s expected to be in health .
in the last month , i had pleasure with the <unk> , &quot; $ 10 million <unk> x prize to announce .
we &apos;re asking teams all around the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with the ai system , you can test your <unk> or your test test .
and to win , the device needs to diagnose a better diagnosis as a team of doctors .
imagine this device . right in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of health care .
if this device is sequenced or <unk> , which is not known , it calls the heart disease and prevents a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are on population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and by the way , the biggest energy market against a population population is a better education and food around the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we go from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before , will be going to join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to want ?
and instead of ecological gridlock , i see one of the biggest economic history in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be able to take a healthier healthier , and they &apos;re getting better trained by <unk> , and so they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d printers and how much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the planet ?
how would it be with a set of new , never <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to pay attention and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that little teams that motivates us to be passionate and focus extraordinary things , things that could only do big companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some may be familiar with .
it &apos;s a game called the foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , to explore how the protein will evolve .
and the after that , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played from university university , etc .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern today is better the proteins , than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best part of the world , this wasn &apos;t a <unk> , no <unk> , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working as an assistant at the day of the <unk> in a <unk> , and at night was the best <unk> of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me tremendous confidence in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask ourselves to the major challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of the passion .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to address the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s required .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical scientist , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in the business for a long time when i can give you a piece of my own wrong <unk> to give it to me .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> , and we &apos;re moving to the world world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turns out statistics and to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 when a bat gets 300 .
that means that the player says that the player beat sure three beats .
this is called the ball into the <unk> , he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , didn &apos;t get done in time , and the runners in safety .
three .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s one of the way that one of the way that it is , in the rest of course , 4 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player who had been met during a <unk> season for 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i &apos;m going to feel a little bit more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less than i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> with a <unk> , which is 400 in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine living in a certain remote area , and they &apos;ve got a beloved person with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> at <unk> , which is at 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the <unk> branch .
and they beat a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe in like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or <unk> should be .
what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re doing each of them , including me in the world with it perfectly .
never make a mistake , no one &apos;s going to think about the details of how this is done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a compulsively <unk> student .
high school in high school has said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the nurses at the sisters of general hospital , <unk> of here .
i learned everything .
in my graduate school , i learned the origins and tail every <unk> , every branch of a every artery , which is <unk> by the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i knew even the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;d collected more and more and more .
and i was good , i did <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school medical school , if i knew everything that i knew , and everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , that i can do immune to mistakes .
and it worked for a time , until i met a little printer .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman printer to me in the expense of the hospital .
at that point , i talked about the <unk> service in <unk> service .
and it was my mission for when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for the <unk> .
giving feedback to me .
i studied woman printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to them , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering from heart failure .
this is a state where the heart was failed , instead of pumping all the blood to pump , part of the blood flow in the lung , and it gradually filling it up , so the <unk> came up .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i asked them , and i went to treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call <unk> , water pills , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over a time and a half or two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take them on the side of it , and i did what i would have had to have had to have a call on what a <unk> would have been on the <unk> , so that he would have had a chance to have a picture .
and he knew her , he had added information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it for good reasons .
maybe i wanted to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to have so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was like that , and so i would be able to deal with my patients without getting to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent her home , i &apos;m going to <unk> a little voice in me trying to say &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was so much lacking to me that i asked the nurse to ask the nurse , &quot; believe it was okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and i said in <unk> art , &quot; clear , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i took the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> , and they brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , dungeon the hospital and went to the parking lot to go home with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there said another nurse , not the nurse who had seen after woman &apos;s printer , but another three words to me , and these three words , i &apos;m afraid of the most <unk> i know .
other medical professionals fear this as well , but the <unk> is especially because we &apos;re seeing patients just as confidently .
the three words say , &quot; remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients they &apos;d send home ? &quot;
asked the nurse <unk> .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and they die .
about an hour after she arrived at home after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 , and the <unk> brought them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure with a blood pressure .
they hardly breathe , and it was blue <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was shocked to the interior .
and i go through this rollercoaster , because she came to the intensive care unit , and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days , she realized she never would awakening .
she hadn &apos;t suffered an <unk> suffered .
their family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they came together .
the day day , they <unk> them -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you &apos;re never to forget the names of people .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next couple of weeks , i kept suggesting to me , and i learned for the first time myself , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , <unk> , not the kind of healthy shame you feel , because you can &apos;t speak to the colleagues of healthy shame .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend &apos;s best friend , even though it &apos;s going to be <unk> on <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to get a best friend and confronted a terrible discussion , and you know , you know , you know , the bad debate is going to be again .
if you do <unk> and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy species i &apos;m talking about is the ones that make a <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one that says to you that &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my <unk> , he was very happy .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was going to be <unk> and sure that i couldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i leave it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i left in medicine ?
but slowly , it took it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke off , and i might say i could feel better again .
and i was born with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again had a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service service in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of stuff , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent it on .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed him on his <unk> .
two days later , i came up to my nearest <unk> and my graduate school asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not infection from the <unk> , but the upper <unk> and causes the <unk> of <unk> .
and luckily he died .
he got <unk> <unk> , and recovered a few days later .
and i went again through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt me , and went back to work until again and again and again and again .
i &apos;ve got two times a british overlooked one .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially if you think about it in a hospital , that &apos;s just at the time that only had 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no imperfections in their treatment .
i thought he had <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> on the front of the kidneys , when it was without <unk> , my colleague in the patient &apos;s patient who was <unk> in the lower right of the patient , and <unk> the <unk> .
the other one had severe diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> on him and asked my colleagues to evaluate him as well .
and he did , and when he discovered a <unk> in the lower of the lower sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and they were fine .
both cases of me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years what many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , embarrassed and support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish with my mistakes and talk about it , if i can talk about the silent voice , which tells me what &apos;s really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i tell you my mistakes so they didn &apos;t do the same ?
if i was going into a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who was talking about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues , and i would ask your immediate support and start telling them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not be able to get the end of the second story before you know , you would go and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that a <unk> in my hospital would have taken someone off the wrong leg , then i believe i would have trouble looking at him .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
there are two basic positions in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who are <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , which is with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response , like antibodies that attack a person .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we are the ones that make mistakes in medicine , that we have a safety system .
but there are two problems .
in my talk about 20 years of medicine and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical mistakes and wrong treatments , so all of my first article for one of my first article i &apos;ve done for the toronto show , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; black species . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in a system every day , where one of the 10 or <unk> is either a false or wrong thing , and it &apos;s always going to be more diverse , and also become more diverse and dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians are dying in <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has <unk> the number 100,000 .
they &apos;re both strong <unk> because we don &apos;t think of the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a corporate sector , the medical knowledge , every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , making him <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> breath , and suddenly the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
and all of that &apos;s kind of errors are inevitable .
so if you take the system like this , how i &apos;ve been taught to do it , and it &apos;s actually edited out all of the brain in the end , there &apos;s no more left .
and do you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white <unk> , black species , i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to every one of the <unk> to the <unk> , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ,
and then you extend your pupils , they &apos;ve come in front of the head , and you look down , and you &apos;re going to swallow , and they &apos;ll start telling her stories .
they want to tell her stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to say to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m doing . &quot;
what you need is an environment that puts them in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the <unk> doctor is a man , really know about his humanity , accepted .
they share their experiences with others .
they supported when others are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a very supportive , supportive way all of it benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s so , then people make a mistake of time .
so that the system is going to be able to create <unk> , which make it easier to find the mistakes that people are bound to do , and it enables people to create their supportive supportive spaces that anyone who &apos;s observed in health care , which can actually address the health .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn the best possible possible to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain that idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about this to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was here .
you may think that he blew <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
we actually collected fish .
he described one of them as very normal .
it was a <unk> .
until the &apos; 80s was in great style , he was found in big style .
now , he &apos;s in the red list of endangered species .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or other places ; it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they were originally .
the <unk> described they still describe them as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to make another concept , <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 for a lagoon in college .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate me up .
and i got a bad one , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really get out there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon from <unk> and a few mangroves were <unk> .
there were <unk> of about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were good at all of them and made in ghana depending on ghana .
when i returned to this 27 years later , the fish was stripped to half its size .
adults measure five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
so it has changed nothing , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story talks about my <unk> &apos;s introduction to the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
back in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe many <unk> .
<unk> countries that had already started the 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing fisheries , this very ugly ship , called <unk> 4th .
i was driving on that , and we did the <unk> all over the southern sea , and especially in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
now i know it was the reason of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the bottom of the ocean came up , and then we got <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within a year , you have an uprising , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changing . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals are getting rid of crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started one alive .
it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of rubble will come up at every time of fishermen , when they drive into areas where they never became surprised .
it &apos;s not going to be recorded .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our <unk> to the new level , and we don &apos;t remember what was there .
and this is what happens when you zoom in .
on the y-axis are some good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green your country , the <unk> .
it changes over time . it changes because of the people , of course , their actions .
every generation looks at the images that they &apos;re doing at the beginning of their conscious life than standard and it will derive everything from it .
the difference then is perceived as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses to you .
there can be a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the tiniest remains .
right now , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we want to get things that disappeared or things that are not more like they were .
you could think now that the problem of people was in <unk> societies , they were killing animals , and they were killed by a few generations what they did .
because obviously an animal that was very common , once once , once it &apos;s <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as big loss .
and at the time , we focus on the large animals and the ocean , the big fish .
they &apos;re less rare because we start them .
over time , little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they will tell you , because the evidence , like you in a previous form of shape , are not as you as you like to prove the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a <unk> project , which can &apos;t be used to be used in this neighborhood , is not being used , or not being used by <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously large role that a marine reserve can play .
because , as marine reserves , we basically think of the past .
we think about the past that people can &apos;t understand , because that changes are changed and very low .
so the people who look at a marine reserve and profit from the insight , which enables you to reset their <unk> .
what about the people that aren &apos;t possible is because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think the art and the film might be filling the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember &quot; avatar perhaps . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this -- except from the <unk> , why were they touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s been <unk> , in a way , <unk> .
so , my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give is cameron is going to be &quot; avatar ii ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the 80s , in the communist <unk> , you had to have a typewriter when you owned a typewriter in the government .
they also had to register a piece of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could trace where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could track the creator of this thought .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that we have free of speech .
in our own countries we would never do this .
but if you can buy a new <unk> on the top of 2011 , and you print a page , then this side of light is <unk> on every side of the side , in a pattern that makes it clear to you and make your printer <unk> .
this is what happens to us today .
and that doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example of what our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> <unk> of these today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> of <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> that made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online online , but they &apos;ve illegal acquired it by using <unk> , for example , to steal money out of our <unk> , while we do our <unk> , or <unk> , who have collected our <unk> on the input on the keyboard .
the u.s. intelligence agency <unk> two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam sam , and on this account were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on its foot , which is not unknown .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to become victims of a <unk> than one crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just getting worse .
in the future , most crime play online .
the second largest <unk> that we see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , like , an opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it for money , <unk> like anonymous , like anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments that lead the attacks .
there are cases in terms of <unk> .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or it was that .
it had to be <unk> in the last fall , because <unk> was hacked .
someone was hacked , and they had a physical hacked .
and last week in a meeting , with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior <unk> to one of the senior people , whether he had died it for possible that because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a series of hacks ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate : if you have a website with a <unk> website , for example , gmail .
now , we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in <unk> states like iran , where they use more and the dissidents that use more like gmail , because they know that they can be able to trust the local government .
but if you go into a foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> and counterfeit <unk> .
and that is exactly what happens in <unk> .
what about the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the insurgent in april 2011 , the headquarters in april 2011 , they found a lot of records .
in this records was a &quot; <unk> &quot; called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , in germany , in a local company , the egyptian government sold some programs that they -- in very large frame -- any communication of the egyptian citizens could capture .
they had sold this program to the egyptian government .
this is right here .
so western governments power governments to <unk> governments , so that they can do their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> , who was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s pretty safety your phone <unk> .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap into their connection .
they use tools like <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> , allowing them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and as we like today , in 2011 , our governments like , is every right that we make forever , forever .
and trust us , trust we are blind to any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to address the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were created by the <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> <unk> <unk> , which fit together .
<unk> became very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the <unk> was going to become a <unk> block of our time .
so almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , some lego .
it was called <unk> rock .
and within a few years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego it for all possible .
lego essentially has the <unk> to the building of the world , taken and made it a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at the same year labs at bell labs the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> , which was a world of static , <unk> building blocks of a world in which everything was interactive .
like <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much bigger and more complex loops , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> one : the transistor was just experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block is reserved for the time , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to study this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i began to develop <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific feature .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
so they can &apos;t put them up wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input , and orange is cable .
so all you need to do is to connect a blue and a green one , and they can build a very quick bit of <unk> .
they add a blue one on a green , and they can make light .
you can turn a switch in between them , and so they created a little <unk> .
take the switch out to get the switch out to <unk> , which is here , insert , and they made a little <unk> .
so they add this <unk> for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
so the simple play is actually quite powerful .
instead of being programming , you have to be able to program <unk> or <unk> , allows them to be simple , intuitive gestures .
so , to slow up , or slow down , you just turn on this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> rock .
lights , sounds , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve been distributed to children and see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electronics that surrounds them in the everyday and not learn in school .
like , for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or as an ipod responds to touch .
we also got <unk> <unk> too .
so , for example , we had no experience with no experience in electronic things , which started playing with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we took risd to risd , and they gave some designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a hummer from play-dough , the fear of the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics just got another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so open source is open source .
you can go to the website , and you can download all the <unk> download and make them .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , the <unk> , because this world that we live in , that interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent it .
thank you .
